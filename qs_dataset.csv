NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/inso,"Lifestyle changes often can help relieve acute (short-term) insomnia. These changes might make it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep.
                
A type of counseling called cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can help relieve the anxiety linked to chronic (ongoing) insomnia. Anxiety tends to prolong insomnia.
                
Several medicines also can help relieve insomnia and re-establish a regular sleep schedule. However, if your insomnia is the symptom or side effect of another problem, it's important to treat the underlying cause (if possible).
                
Lifestyle Changes
                
If you have insomnia, avoid substances that make it worse, such as:
                
Caffeine, tobacco, and other stimulants. The effects of these substances can last as long as 8 hours.
                
Certain over-the-counter and prescription medicines that can disrupt sleep (for example, some cold and allergy medicines). Talk with your doctor about which medicines won't disrupt your sleep.
                
Alcohol. An alcoholic drink before bedtime might make it easier for you to fall asleep. However, alcohol triggers sleep that tends to be lighter than normal. This makes it more likely that you will wake up during the night.
                
Try to adopt bedtime habits that make it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep. Follow a routine that helps you wind down and relax before bed. For example, read a book, listen to soothing music, or take a hot bath.
                
Try to schedule your daily exercise at least 5 to 6 hours before going to bed. Don't eat heavy meals or drink a lot before bedtime.
                
Make your bedroom sleep-friendly. Avoid bright lighting while winding down. Try to limit possible distractions, such as a TV, computer, or pet. Make sure the temperature of your bedroom is cool and comfortable. Your bedroom also should be dark and quiet.
                
Go to sleep around the same time each night and wake up around the same time each morning, even on weekends. If you can, avoid night shifts, alternating schedules, or other things that may disrupt your sleep schedule.
                
Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy
                
CBT for insomnia targets the thoughts and actions that can disrupt sleep. This therapy encourages good sleep habits and uses several methods to relieve sleep anxiety.
                
For example, relaxation techniques and biofeedback are used to reduce anxiety. These strategies help you better control your breathing, heart rate, muscles, and mood.
                
CBT also aims to replace sleep anxiety with more positive thinking that links being in bed with being asleep. This method also teaches you what to do if you're unable to fall asleep within a reasonable time.
                
CBT also may involve talking with a therapist one-on-one or in group sessions to help you consider your thoughts and feelings about sleep. This method may encourage you to describe thoughts racing through your mind in terms of how they look, feel, and sound. The goal is for your mind to settle down and stop racing.
                
CBT also focuses on limiting the time you spend in bed while awake. This method involves setting a sleep schedule. At first, you will limit your total time in bed to the typical short length of time you're usually asleep.
                
This schedule might make you even more tired because some of the allotted time in bed will be taken up by problems falling asleep. However, the resulting tiredness is intended to help you get to sleep more quickly. Over time, the length of time spent in bed is increased until you get a full night of sleep.
                
For success with CBT, you may need to see a therapist who is skilled in this approach weekly over 2 to 3 months. CBT works as well as prescription medicine for many people who have chronic insomnia. It also may provide better long-term relief than medicine alone.
                
For people who have insomnia and major depressive disorder, CBT combined with antidepression medicines has shown promise in relieving both conditions.
                
Medicines
                
Prescription Medicines
                
Many prescription medicines are used to treat insomnia. Some are meant for short-term use, while others are meant for longer use.
                
Talk to your doctor about the benefits and side effects of insomnia medicines. For example, insomnia medicines can help you fall asleep, but you may feel groggy in the morning after taking them.
                
Rare side effects of these medicines include sleep eating, sleep walking, or driving while asleep. If you have side effects from an insomnia medicine, or if it doesn't work well, tell your doctor. He or she might prescribe a different medicine.
                
Some insomnia medicines can be habit forming. Ask your doctor about the benefits and risks of insomnia medicines.
                
Over-the-Counter Products
                
Some over-the-counter (OTC) products claim to treat insomnia. These products include melatonin, L-tryptophan supplements, and valerian teas or extracts.
                
The Food and Drug Administration doesn't regulate natural products and some food supplements. Thus, the dose and purity of these substances can vary. How well these products work and how safe they are isn't well understood.
                
Some OTC products that contain antihistamines are sold as sleep aids. Although these products might make you sleepy, talk to your doctor before taking them.
                
Antihistamines pose risks for some people. Also, these products may not offer the best treatment for your insomnia. Your doctor can advise you whether these products will benefit you.",treatment,Insomnia,What are the treatments for Insomnia ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/ards,"ARDS is treated in a hospital's intensive care unit. Current treatment approaches focus on improving blood oxygen levels and providing supportive care. Doctors also will try to pinpoint and treat the underlying cause of the condition.
                
Oxygen Therapy
                
One of the main goals of treating ARDS is to provide oxygen to your lungs and other organs (such as your brain and kidneys). Your organs need oxygen to work properly.
                
Oxygen usually is given through nasal prongs or a mask that fits over your mouth and nose. However, if your oxygen level doesn't rise or it's still hard for you to breathe, your doctor will give you oxygen through a breathing tube. He or she will insert the flexible tube through your mouth or nose and into your windpipe.
                
Before inserting the tube, your doctor will squirt or spray a liquid medicine into your throat (and possibly your nose) to make it numb. Your doctor also will give you medicine through an intravenous (IV) line in your bloodstream to make you sleepy and relaxed.
                
The breathing tube will be connected to a machine that supports breathing (a ventilator). The ventilator will fill your lungs with oxygen-rich air.
                
Your doctor will adjust the ventilator as needed to help your lungs get the right amount of oxygen. This also will help prevent injury to your lungs from the pressure of the ventilator.
                
You'll use the breathing tube and ventilator until you can breathe on your own. If you need a ventilator for more than a few days, your doctor may do a tracheotomy (tra-ke-OT-o-me).
                
This procedure involves making a small cut in your neck to create an opening to the windpipe. The opening is called a tracheostomy (TRA-ke-OS-to-me). Your doctor will place the breathing tube directly into the windpipe. The tube is then connected to the ventilator.
                
For more information, go to the Health Topics Oxygen Therapy article.
                
Supportive Care
                
Supportive care refers to treatments that help relieve symptoms, prevent complications, or improve quality of life. Supportive approaches used to treat ARDS include:
                
Medicines to help you relax, relieve discomfort, and treat pain.
                
Ongoing monitoring of heart and lung function (including blood pressure and gas exchange).
                
Nutritional support. People who have ARDS often suffer from malnutrition. Thus, extra nutrition may be given through a feeding tube.
                
Treatment for infections. People who have ARDS are at higher risk for infections, such as pneumonia. Being on a ventilator also increases the risk of infections. Doctors use antibiotics to treat pneumonia and other infections.
                
Prevention of blood clots. Lying down for long periods can cause blood clots to form in the deep veins of your body. These clots can travel to your lungs and block blood flow (a condition called pulmonary embolism). Blood-thinning medicines and other treatments, such as compression stocking (stockings that create gentle pressure up the leg), are used to prevent blood clots.
                
Prevention of intestinal bleeding. People who receive long-term support from a ventilator are at increased risk of bleeding in the intestines. Medicines can reduce this risk.
                
Fluids. You may be given fluids to improve blood flow through your body and to provide nutrition. Your doctor will make sure you get the right amount of fluids. Fluids usually are given through an IV line inserted into one of your blood vessels.",treatment,ARDS,What are the treatments for ARDS ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/ohs,"Treatments for obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) include breathing support, weight loss, and medicines.
                
The goals of treating OHS may include:
                
Supporting and aiding your breathing
                
Achieving major weight loss
                
Treating underlying and related conditions
                
Breathing Support
                
Positive Airway Pressure
                
Treatment for OHS often involves a machine that provides positive airway pressure (PAP) while you sleep.
                
PAP therapy uses mild air pressure to keep your airways open. This treatment can help your body better maintain the carbon dioxide and oxygen levels in your blood. PAP therapy also can help relieve daytime sleepiness.
                
Your doctor might recommend CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) or BiPAP (bilevel positive airway pressure). CPAP provides continuous mild air pressure to keep your airways open. BiPAP works almost the same, but it changes the air pressure while you breathe in and out.
                
The machines have three main parts:
                
A mask or other device that fits over your nose or your nose and mouth. Straps keep the mask in place while you're wearing it.
                
A tube that connects the mask to the machine's motor.
                
A motor that blows air into the tube.
                
Some machines have other features, such as heated humidifiers. The machines are small, lightweight, and fairly quiet. The noise they make is soft and rhythmic.
                
Some people who have OHS receive extra oxygen as part of their PAP treatment. However, oxygen therapy alone isn't recommended as a treatment for OHS.
                
PAP therapy also is used to treat obstructive sleep apnea. Many people who have OHS also have this common condition.
                
If your doctor prescribes PAP therapy, you'll work with someone from a home equipment provider to select a CPAP or BiPAP machine. The home equipment provider will help you pick a machine based on your prescription and the features that meet your needs.
                
Ventilator Support
                
If you have severe OHS that requires treatment in a hospital, you might be put on a ventilator. A ventilator is a machine that supports breathing. This machine:
                
Gets oxygen into your lungs
                
Removes carbon dioxide from your body
                
Helps you breathe easier
                
A ventilator blows air, or air with extra oxygen, into the airways through a breathing tube. One end of the tube is inserted into your windpipe, and the other end is hooked to the ventilator.
                
Usually, the breathing tube is put into your nose or mouth and then moved down into your throat. A tube placed like this is called an endotracheal (en-do-TRA-ke-al) tube. Endotracheal tubes are used only in a hospital setting.
                
Sometimes the breathing tube is placed through a surgically made hole called a tracheostomy (TRA-ke-OS-toe-me). The hole goes through the front of your neck and into your windpipe.
                
The procedure to make a tracheostomy usually is done in an operating room. You'll be given medicine so you won't feel any pain. The tracheostomy allows you to be on a ventilator in the hospital, in a long-term care facility, or at home.
                
Talk with your doctor about how long you'll need ventilator support and whether you can receive treatment at home.
                
For more information about ventilator support, go to the Health Topics Ventilator/Ventilator Support article.
                
Weight Loss
                
Your doctor will likely recommend weight loss as part of your treatment plan. Successful weight loss often involves setting goals and making lifestyle changes. For example, eating fewer calories and being physically active can help you lose weight.
                
Medicines and weight-loss surgery might be an option if lifestyle changes aren't enough. Your doctor will advise you on the best weight-loss treatment for you.
                
For more information about weight loss, go to the treatment section of the Health Topics Overweight and Obesity article.
                
Medicines
                
Your doctor may prescribe medicines to treat OHS (although this treatment is less common than others).
                
Your doctor also may advise you to avoid certain substances and medicines that can worsen OHS. Examples include alcohol, sedatives, and narcotics. They can interfere with how well your body is able to maintain normal carbon dioxide and oxygen levels.
                
If you're having surgery, make sure you tell your surgeon and health care team that you have OHS. Some medicines routinely used for surgery can worsen your condition.",treatment,Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome,What are the treatments for Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/ohs,"You can prevent obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) by maintaining a healthy weight. However, not everyone who is obese develops OHS. Researchers don't fully know why only some people who are obese develop the condition.
                
Adopting healthy habits can help you maintain a healthy weight. Many lifestyle habits begin during childhood. So, it's important to make following a healthy lifestyle a family goal.
                
A healthy diet is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. A healthy diet includes a variety of vegetables and fruits. It also includes whole grains, fat-free or low-fat dairy products, and protein foods, such as lean meats, eggs, poultry without skin, seafood, nuts, seeds, beans, and peas.
                
A healthy diet is low in sodium (salt), added sugars, solid fats, and refined grains. Solid fats are saturated fat and trans fatty acids. Refined grains come from processing whole grains, which results in a loss of nutrients (such as dietary fiber). Examples of refined grains include white rice and white bread.
                
For more information about following a healthy diet, go to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's ""Your Guide to Lowering Your Blood Pressure With DASH"" and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's ChooseMyPlate.gov Web site. Both resources provide general information about healthy eating.
                
To adopt other healthy lifestyle habits, follow these tips:
                
Focus on portion size. Watch the portion sizes in fast food and other restaurants. The portions served often are enough for two or three people. Children's portion sizes should be smaller than those for adults. Cutting back on portion sizes will help you manage your calorie intake.
                
Be physically active. Make personal and family time as active as possible. Find activities that everyone will enjoy. For example, go for a brisk walk, bike or rollerblade, or train together for a walk or run.
                
Reduce screen time. Limit the use of TVs, computers, DVDs, and videogames; they cut back on the time for physical activity. Health experts recommend2 hours or less a day of screen time that's not work- or homework-related.
                
Keep track of your weight and body mass index (BMI). BMI is calculated from your height and weight. In adults, a BMI of 30 or more is considered obese. You can use the NHLBI's online BMI calculator to figure out your BMI, or your doctor can help you.
                
For more information, go to the prevention section of the Health Topics Overweight and Obesity article.
                
Even if you have OHS, you might be able to prevent the condition from worsening. For example, avoid alcohol, sedatives, and narcotics.

NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/scda,"Emergency Treatment
                
Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is an emergency. A person having SCA needs to be treated with a defibrillator right away. This device sends an electric shock to the heart. The electric shock can restore a normal rhythm to a heart that's stopped beating.
                
To work well, defibrillation must be done within minutes of SCA. With every minute that passes, the chances of surviving SCA drop rapidly.
                
Police, emergency medical technicians, and other first responders usually are trained and equipped to use a defibrillator. Call 911 right away if someone has signs or symptoms of SCA. The sooner you call for help, the sooner lifesaving treatment can begin.
                
Automated External Defibrillators
                
Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are special defibrillators that untrained bystanders can use. These portable devices often are found in public places, such as shopping malls, golf courses, businesses, airports, airplanes, casinos, convention centers, hotels, sports venues, and schools.
                
AEDs are programmed to give an electric shock if they detect a dangerous arrhythmia, such as ventricular fibrillation. This prevents giving a shock to someone who may have fainted but isn't having SCA.
                
You should give cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to a person having SCA until defibrillation can be done.
                
People who are at risk for SCA may want to consider having an AED at home. A 2008 study by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the National Institutes of Health found that AEDs in the home are safe and effective.
                
Some people feel that placing these devices in homes will save many lives because many SCAs occur at home.Others note that no evidence supports the idea that home-use AEDs save more lives. These people fear that people who have AEDs in their homes will delay calling for help during an emergency. They're also concerned that people who have home-use AEDs will not properly maintain the devices or forget where they are.
                
When considering a home-use AED, talk with your doctor. He or she can help you decide whether having an AED in your home will benefit you.
                
Treatment in a Hospital
                
If you survive SCA, you'll likely be admitted to a hospital for ongoing care and treatment. In the hospital, your medical team will closely watch your heart. They may give you medicines to try to reduce the risk of another SCA.
                
While in the hospital, your medical team will try to find out what caused your SCA. If you're diagnosed with coronary heart disease, you may havepercutaneous coronary intervention, also known as coronary angioplasty,or coronary artery bypass grafting. These procedures help restore blood flow through narrowed or blocked coronary arteries.
                
Often, people who have SCA get a device called an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). This small device is surgically placed under the skin in your chest or abdomen. An ICD uses electric pulses or shocks to help control dangerous arrhythmias. (For more information, go to ""How Can Death Due to Sudden Cardiac Arrest Be Prevented?"")",treatment,Sudden Cardiac Arrest,What are the treatments for Sudden Cardiac Arrest ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/scda,"Ways to prevent death due to sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) differ depending on whether:
                
You've already had SCA
                
You've never had SCA but are at high risk for the condition
                
You've never had SCA and have no known risk factors for the condition
                
For People Who Have Survived Sudden Cardiac Arrest
                
If you've already had SCA, you're at high risk of having it again. Research shows that an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) reduces the chances of dying from a second SCA.An ICD is surgically placed under the skin in your chest or abdomen. The device has wires with electrodes on the ends that connect to your heart's chambers. The ICD monitors your heartbeat.
                
If the ICD detects a dangerous heart rhythm, it gives an electric shock to restore the heart's normal rhythm. Your doctor may give you medicine to limit irregular heartbeats that can trigger the ICD.
                
Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator
                

                
An ICD isn't the same as a pacemaker. The devices are similar, but they have some differences. Pacemakers give off low-energy electrical pulses. They're often used to treat less dangerous heart rhythms, such as those that occur in the upper chambers of the heart. Most new ICDs work as both pacemakers and ICDs.
                
For People at High Risk for a First Sudden Cardiac Arrest
                
If you have severe coronary heart disease (CHD), you're at increased risk for SCA. This is especially true if you've recently had a heart attack.
                
Your doctor may prescribe a type of medicine called a beta blocker to help lower your risk for SCA. Your doctor also may discuss beginning statin treatment if you have an elevated risk for developing heart disease or having a stroke. Doctors usually prescribe statins for people who have:
                
Diabetes
                
Heart disease or had a prior stroke
                
High LDL cholesterol levels
                
Your doctor also may prescribe other medications to:
                
Decrease your chance of having a heart attack or dying suddenly.
                
Lower blood pressure.
                
Prevent blood clots, which can lead to heart attack or stroke.
                
Prevent or delay the need for a procedure or surgery, such as angioplasty or coronary artery bypass grafting.
                
Reduce your hearts workload and relieve coronary heart disease symptoms.
                
Take all medicines regularly, as your doctor prescribes. Dont change the amount of your medicine or skip a dose unless your doctor tells you to. You should still follow a heart-healthy lifestyle, even if you take medicines to treat your coronary heart disease.
                
Other treatments for coronary heart diseasesuch as percutaneous coronary intervention, also known as coronary angioplasty, or coronary artery bypass graftingalso may lower your risk for SCA. Your doctor also may recommend an ICD if youre at high risk for SCA.
                
For People Who Have No Known Risk Factors for Sudden Cardiac Arrest
                
CHD seems to be the cause of most SCAs in adults. CHD also is a major risk factor for angina (chest pain or discomfort) and heart attack, and it contributes to other heart problems.
                
Following a healthy lifestyle can help you lower your risk for CHD, SCA, and other heart problems. A heart-healthy lifestyle includes:
                
Heart-healthy eating
                
Maintaining a healthy weight
                
Managing stress
                
Physical activity
                
Quitting smoking
                
Heart-Healthy Eating
                
Heart-healthy eating is an important part of a heart-healthy lifestyle. Your doctor may recommend heart-healthy eating, which should include:
                
Fat-free or low-fat dairy products, such as skim milk
                
Fish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and trout, about twice a week
                
Fruits, such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes
                
Legumes, such as kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans
                
Vegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and carrots
                
Whole grains, such as oatmeal, brown rice, and corn tortillas
                
When following a heart-healthy diet, you should avoid eating:
                
A lot of red meat
                
Palm and coconut oils
                
Sugary foods and beverages
                
Two nutrients in your diet make blood cholesterol levels rise:
                
Saturated fatfound mostly in foods that come from animals
                
Trans fat (trans fatty acids)found in foods made with hydrogenated oils and fats, such as stick margarine; baked goods, such as cookies, cakes, and pies; crackers; frostings; and coffee creamers. Some trans fats also occur naturally in animal fats and meats.
                
Saturated fat raises your blood cholesterol more than anything else in your diet. When you follow a heart-healthy eating plan, only 5percent to 6percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. Food labels list the amounts of saturated fat. To help you stay on track, here are some examples:
                
If you eat:
                
Try to eat no more than:
                
1,200 calories a day              
                
8 grams of saturated fat a day

Not all fats are bad. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats actually help lower blood cholesterol levels. Some sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are:
                
Avocados
                
Corn, sunflower, and soybean oils
                
Nuts and seeds, such as walnuts
                
Olive, canola, peanut, safflower, and sesame oils
                
Peanut butter
                
Salmon and trout
                
Tofu
                
Sodium
                
You should try to limit the amount of sodium that you eat. This means choosing and preparing foods that are lower in salt and sodium. Try to use low-sodium and no added salt foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. Food labels tell you what you need to know about choosing foods that are lower in sodium. Try to eat no more than 2,300milligrams of sodium a day. If you have high blood pressure, you may need to restrict your sodium intake even more.
                
Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension
                
Your doctor may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan if you have high blood pressure. The DASH eating plan focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and low in fat, cholesterol, and sodium and salt.
                
The DASH eating plan is a good heart-healthy eating plan, even for those who dont have high blood pressure. Read more about DASH.
                
Limiting Alcohol
                
Try to limit alcohol intake. Too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure and triglyceride levels, a type of fat found in the blood. Alcohol also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain.
                
Men should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day. Women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day. One drink is:
                
12 ounces of beer
                
5 ounces of wine
                
1 ounces of liquor
                
Maintaining a Healthy Weight
                
Maintaining a healthy weight is important for overall health and can lower your risk for sudden cardiac arrest. Aim for a Healthy Weight by following a heart-healthy eating plan and keeping physically active.
                
Knowing your body mass index (BMI) helps you find out if youre a healthy weight in relation to your height and gives an estimate of your total body fat. To figure out your BMI, check out the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes online BMI calculator or talk to your doctor. A BMI:
                
Below 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight.
                
Between 18.5 and 24.9 is in the normal range
                
Between 25.0 and 29.9 is considered overweight
                
Of 30.0 or higher is considered obese
                
A general goal to aim for is a BMI of less than 25. Your doctor or health care provider can help you set an appropriate BMI goal.
                
Measuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. If most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type2 diabetes. This risk may be higher with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. To learn how to measure your waist, visit Assessing Your Weight and Health Risk.
                
If youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. A loss of just 3percent to 5percent of your current weight can lower your triglycerides, blood glucose, and the risk of developing type2 diabetes. Greater amounts of weight loss can improve blood pressure readings, lower LDL cholesterol, and increase HDL cholesterol.
                
Managing Stress
                
Managing and coping with stress. Learning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health. Consider healthy stress-reducing activities, such as:
                
A stress management program
                
Meditation
                
Physical activity
                
Relaxation therapy
                
Talking things out with friends or family
                
Physical Activity
                
Regular physical activity can lower your risk for coronary heart disease, sudden cardiac arrest, and other health problems. Everyone should try to participate in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2hours and 30minutes per week or vigorous aerobic exercise for 1hour and 15minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats faster and you use more oxygen than usual. The more active you are, the more you will benefit. Participate in aerobic exercise for at least 10minutes at a time spread throughout the week.
                
Talk with your doctor before you start a new exercise plan. Ask your doctor how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you.

Quitting Smoking
                
People who smoke are more likely to have a heart attack than are people who dont smoke. The risk of having a heart attack increases with the number of cigarettes smoked each day. Smoking also raises your risk for stroke and lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer.
                
Quitting smoking can greatly reduce your risk for heart and lung diseases. Ask your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke. If you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking.

NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/pleurisy,"Pleurisy and other pleural disorders are treated with procedures, medicines, and other methods. The goals of treatment include:
                
Relieving symptoms
                
Removing the fluid, air, or blood from the pleural space (if a large amount is present)
                
Treating the underlying condition
                
Relieving Symptoms
                
To relieve pleurisy symptoms, your doctor may recommend:
                
Acetaminophen or anti-inflammatory medicines (such as ibuprofen) to control pain.
                
Codeine-based cough syrups to controlcoughing.
                
Lying on your painful side. This might make you more comfortable.
                
Breathing deeply and coughing to clear mucus as the pain eases. Otherwise, you may developpneumonia.
                
Getting plenty of rest.
                
Removing Fluid, Air, or Blood From the Pleural Space
                
Your doctor may recommend removing fluid, air, or blood from your pleural space to prevent a lung collapse.
                
The procedures used to drain fluid, air, or blood from the pleural space are similar.
                
Duringthoracentesis, your doctor will insert a thin needle or plastic tube into the pleural space. An attached syringe will draw fluid out of your chest. This procedure can remove more than 6 cups of fluid at a time.
                
If your doctor needs to remove a lot of fluid, he or she may use a chest tube. Your doctor will inject a painkiller into the area of your chest wall where the fluid is. He or she will then insert a plastic tube into your chest between two ribs. The tube will be connected to a box that suctions out the fluid. Your doctor will use achest x ray to check the tube's position.
                
Your doctor also can use a chest tube to drain blood and air from the pleural space. This process can take several days. The tube will be left in place, and you'll likely stay in the hospital during this time.
                
Sometimes the fluid in the pleural space contains thick pus or blood clots. It may form a hard skin or peel, which makes the fluid harder to drain. To help break up the pus or blood clots, your doctor may use a chest tube to deliver medicines called fibrinolytics to the pleural space. If the fluid still won't drain, you may need surgery.
                
If you have a small, persistent air leak into the pleural space, your doctor may attach a one-way valve to the chest tube. The valve allows air to exit the pleural space, but not reenter. Using this type of valve may allow you to continue your treatment from home.
                
Treat the Underlying Condition
                
The fluid sample that was removed during thoracentesis will be checked under a microscope. This can tell your doctor what's causing the fluid buildup, and he or she can decide the best way to treat it.
                
If the fluid is infected, treatment will involve antibiotics and drainage. If you have tuberculosis or a fungal infection, treatment will involve long-term use of antibiotics or antifungal medicines.
                
If tumors in the pleura are causing fluid buildup, the fluid may quickly build up again after it's drained. Sometimes antitumor medicines will prevent further fluid buildup. If they don't, your doctor may seal the pleural space. Sealing the pleural space is called pleurodesis (plur-OD-eh-sis).
                
For this procedure, your doctor will drain all of the fluid out of your chest through a chest tube. Then he or she will push a substance through the chest tube into the pleural space. The substance will irritate the surface of the pleura. This will cause the two layers of the pleura to stick together, preventing more fluid from building up.
                
Chemotherapy or radiation treatment also may be used to reduce the size of the tumors.
                
Ifheart failureis causing fluid buildup, treatment usually includes diuretics (medicines that help reduce fluid buildup) and other medicines.",treatment,Pleurisy and Other Pleural Disorders,What are the treatments for Pleurisy and Other Pleural Disorders ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/holes,"Many holes in the heart don't need treatment, but some do. Those that do often are repaired during infancy or early childhood. Sometimes adults are treated for holes in the heart if problems develop.
                
The treatment your child receives depends on the type, location, and size of the hole. Other factors include your child's age, size, and general health.
                
Treating an Atrial Septal Defect
                
If a child has an atrial septal defect (ASD), routine checkups are done to see whether it closes on its own. About half of all ASDs close on their own over time, and about 20 percent close within the first year of life.
                
Your child's doctor will let you know how often your child should have checkups. For an ASD, frequent checkups aren't needed.
                
If an ASD requires treatment, catheter or surgical procedures are used to close the hole. Doctors often decide to close ASDs in children who still have medium- or large-sized holes by the time they're 2 to 5 years old.
                
Catheter Procedure
                
Until the early 1990s, surgery was the usual method for closing all ASDs. Now, thanks to medical advances, doctors can use catheter procedures to close secundum ASDs. These are the most common type of ASD.
                
Before a catheter procedure, your child is given medicine so he or she will sleep and not feel any pain. Then, the doctor inserts a catheter (a thin, flexible tube) into a vein in the groin (upper thigh). He or she threads the tube to the heart's septum. A device made up of two small disks or an umbrella-like device is attached to the catheter.
                
When the catheter reaches the septum, the device is pushed out of the catheter. The device is placed so that it plugs the hole between the atria. It's secured in place and the catheter is withdrawn from the body.
                
Within 6 months, normal tissue grows in and over the device. The closure device does not need to be replaced as the child grows.
                
Doctors often use echocardiography (echo), transesophageal (tranz-ih-sof-uh-JEE-ul) echo (TEE), and coronary angiography (an-jee-OG-rah-fee) to guide them in threading the catheter to the heart and closing the defect. TEE is a special type of echo that takes pictures of the heart through the esophagus. The esophagus is the passage leading from the mouth to the stomach.
                
Catheter procedures are much easier on patients than surgery. They involve only a needle puncture in the skin where the catheter is inserted. This means that recovery is faster and easier.
                
The outlook for children having this procedure is excellent. Closures are successful in more than 9 out of 10 patients, with no major leakage. Rarely, a defect is too large for catheter closure and surgery is needed.
                
Surgery
                
Open-heart surgery generally is done to repair primum or sinus venosus ASDs. Before the surgery, your child is given medicine so he or she will sleep and not feel any pain.
                
Then, the cardiac surgeon makes an incision (cut) in the chest to reach the ASD. He or she repairs the defect with a special patch that covers the hole. A heart-lung bypass machine is used during the surgery so the surgeon can open the heart. The machine takes over the heart's pumping action and moves blood away from the heart.
                
The outlook for children who have ASD surgery is excellent. On average, children spend 3 to 4 days in the hospital before going home. Complications, such as bleeding and infection, are very rare.
                
In some children, the outer lining of the heart may become inflamed. This condition is called pericarditis (PER-i-kar-DI-tis). The inflammation causes fluid to collect around the heart in the weeks after surgery. Medicine usually can treat this condition.
                
While in the hospital, your child will be given medicine as needed to reduce pain or anxiety. The doctors and nurses at the hospital will teach you how to care for your child at home.
                
They will talk about preventing blows to the chest as the incision heals, limiting activity while your child recovers, bathing, scheduling ongoing care, and deciding when your child can go back to his or her regular activities.
                
Treating a Ventricular Septal Defect
                
Doctors may choose to monitor children who have ventricular septal defects (VSDs) but no symptoms of heart failure. This means regular checkups and tests to see whether the defect closes on its own or gets smaller.
                
More than half of VSDs eventually close, usually by the time children are in preschool. Your child's doctor will let you know how often your child needs checkups. Checkups may range from once a month to once every 1 or 2 years.
                
If treatment for a VSD is required, options include extra nutrition and surgery to close the VSD. Doctors also can use catheter procedures to close some VSDs. They may use this approach if surgery isn't possible or doesn't work. More research is needed to find out the risks and benefits of using catheter procedures to treat VSDs.
                
Extra Nutrition
                
Some infants who have VSDs don't grow and develop or gain weight as they should. These infants usually:
                
Have large VSDs
                
Are born too early
                
Tire easily during feeding
                
Doctors usually recommend extra nutrition or special feedings for these infants. These feedings are high-calorie formulas or breast milk supplements that give babies extra nourishment.
                
Some infants need tube feeding. A small tube is inserted into the mouth and moved down into the stomach. Food is given through the tube.
                
Tube feeding can add to or take the place of bottle feeding. This treatment often is short-term because a VSD that causes symptoms will likely require surgery.
                
Surgery
                
Most doctors recommend surgery to close large VSDs that are causing symptoms, affecting the aortic valve, or haven't closed by the time children are 1 year old. Surgery may be needed earlier if:
                
A child doesn't gain weight
                
Medicines are needed to control the symptoms of heart failure
                
Rarely, medium-sized VSDs that are causing enlarged heart chambers are treated with surgery after infancy. However, most VSDs that require surgery are repaired in the first year of life. Doctors use open-heart surgery and patches to close VSDs.",treatment,Holes in the Heart,What are the treatments for Holes in the Heart ?,Drugs

Antibiotics
                
Antibiotics usually are given for 2 to 6 weeks through an intravenous (IV) line inserted into a vein. You're often in a hospital for at least the first week or more of treatment. This allows your doctor to make sure the medicine is helping.
                
If you're allowed to go home before the treatment is done, the antibiotics are almost always continued by vein at home. You'll need special care if you get IV antibiotic treatment at home. Before you leave the hospital, your medical team will arrange for you to receive home-based care so you can continue your treatment.
                
You also will need close medical followup, usually by a team of doctors. This team often includes a doctor who specializes in infectious diseases, a cardiologist (heart specialist), and a heart surgeon.
                
Surgery

The goals of treatment are to cure the infection and prevent complications.
                
General Treatment
                
If you have pneumonia, follow your treatment plan, take all medicines as prescribed, and get ongoing medical care. Ask your doctor when you should schedule followup care. Your doctor may want you to have a chest x ray to make sure the pneumonia is gone.
                
Although you may start feeling better after a few days or weeks, fatigue (tiredness) can persist for up to a month or more. People who are treated in the hospital may need at least 3 weeks before they can go back to their normal routines.
                
Bacterial Pneumonia
                
Bacterial pneumonia is treated with medicines called antibiotics. You should take antibiotics as your doctor prescribes. You may start to feel better before you finish the medicine, but you should continue taking it as prescribed. If you stop too soon, the pneumonia may come back.
                
Most people begin to improve after 1 to 3 days of antibiotic treatment. This means that they should feel better and have fewer symptoms, such as cough and fever.
                
Viral Pneumonia
                
Antibiotics don't work when the cause of pneumonia is a virus. If you have viral pneumonia, your doctor may prescribe an antiviral medicine to treat it.
                
Viral pneumonia usually improves in 1 to 3 weeks.
                
Treating Severe Symptoms

The overall goals of treating P.A.D. include reducing risk of heart attack and stroke; reducing symptoms of claudication; improving mobility and overall quality of life; and preventing complications. Treatment is based on your signs and symptoms, risk factors, and the results of physical exams and tests.
                

                
Treatment may slow or stop the progression of the disease and reduce the risk of complications. Without treatment, P.A.D. may progress, resulting in serious tissue damage in the form of sores or gangrene (tissue death) due to inadequate blood flow. In extreme cases of P.A.D., also referred to as critical limb ischemia (CLI), removal (amputation) of part of the leg or foot may be necessary.
                

                

                
Lifestyle Changes
                
Treatment often includes making long-lasting lifestyle changes, such as:
                
Physical activity
                
Quitting smoking
                
Heart-healthy eating
                

                
Physical Activity
                
Routine physical activity can improve P.A.D. symptoms and lower many risk factors for atherosclerosis, including LDL (bad) cholesterol, high blood pressure, and excess weight. Exercise can improve the distances you can comfortably walk.
                
Talk with your doctor about taking part in a supervised exercise program. If a supervised program is not an option, ask your doctor to help you develop an exercise plan. Most exercise programs begin slowly, which includes simple walking alternating with rest. Over time, most people build up the amount of time they can walk before developing pain. The more active you are, the more you will benefit.
                

                

                
Quitting Smoking
                
If you smoke, quit. Smoking raises your risk for P.A.D. Smoking also raises your risk for other diseases, such as coronary heart disease and heart attack, and worsens other coronary heart disease risk factors. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhandsmoke.
                
If you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking.

Heart-Healthy Eating
                
Your doctor may recommend heart-healthy eating to treat atherosclerosis, the most common cause of P.A.D. Following heart-healthy eating can help control blood pressure and cholesterol levels, which can lead to atherosclerosis.
                

                
Medicines
                
Your doctor may prescribe medicines to:
                
Prevent blood clots from forming due to low blood flow with anticlotting medicines, such as aspirin.
                
Treat unhealthy cholesterol levels with statins. Statins control or lower blood cholesterol. By lowering your blood cholesterol level, you can decrease your chance of developing complications from P.A.D.
                
Treat high blood pressure with one of many high blood pressure medicines.
                
Help ease leg pain that occurs when you walk or climb stairs.
                
Reduce the symptoms of intermittent claudication, measured by increased walking distance with certain platelet-aggregation inhibitors.
                

                
Surgery or Procedures
                
Bypass Grafting
                
Your doctor may recommend bypass grafting surgery if blood flow in your limb is blocked or nearly blocked. For this surgery, your doctor uses a blood vessel from another part of your body or a synthetic tube to make a graft.
                
This graft bypasses (that is, goes around) the blocked part of the artery. The bypass allows blood to flow around the blockage. This surgery doesnt cure P.A.D., but it may increase blood flow to the affected limb.
                

                
Angioplasty and Stent Placement
                
Your doctor may recommend angioplasty to restore blood flow through a narrowed or blockedartery.
                
During this procedure, a catheter (thin tube) with a balloon at the tip is inserted into a blocked artery. The balloon is then inflated, which pushes plaque outward against the artery wall. This widens the artery and restores blood flow.
                

                
A stent (a small mesh tube) may be placed in the artery during angioplasty. A stent helps keep the artery open after angioplasty is done. Some stents are coated with medicine to help prevent blockages in the artery.
                

                
Atherectomy
                
Atherectomy is a procedure that removes plaque buildup from an artery. During the procedure, a catheter is used to insert a small cutting device into the blocked artery. The device is used to shave or cut off plaque.
                
The bits of plaque are removed from the body through the catheter or washed away in the bloodstream (if theyre small enough).
                

                
Doctors also can perform atherectomy using a special laser that dissolves the blockage.

NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/prnanmia,"Doctors treat pernicious anemia by replacing the missing vitamin B12 in the body. People who have pernicious anemia may need lifelong treatment.
                
The goals of treating pernicious anemia include:
                
Preventing or treating the anemia and its signs and symptoms
                
Preventing or managing complications, such as heart and nerve damage
                
Treating the cause of the pernicious anemia (if a cause can be found)
                
Specific Types of Treatment
                
Pernicious anemia usually is easy to treat with vitamin B12 shots or pills.
                
If you have severe pernicious anemia, your doctor may recommend shots first. Shots usually are given in a muscle every day or every week until the level of vitamin B12 in your blood increases. After your vitamin B12 blood level returns to normal, you may get a shot only once a month.
                
For less severe pernicious anemia, your doctor may recommend large doses of vitamin B12 pills. A vitamin B12 nose gel and spray also are available. These products may be useful for people who have trouble swallowing pills, such as older people who have had strokes.
                
Your signs and symptoms may begin to improve within a few days after you start treatment. Your doctor may advise you to limit your physical activity until your condition improves.
                
If your pernicious anemia is caused by something other than a lack of intrinsic factor, you may get treatment for the cause (if a cause can be found). For example, your doctor may prescribe medicines to treat a condition that prevents your body from absorbing vitamin B12.
                
If medicines are the cause of your pernicious anemia, your doctor may change the type or dose of medicine you take. Infants of strict vegetarian mothers may be given vitamin B12 supplements from birth.",treatment,Pernicious Anemia,What are the treatments for Pernicious Anemia ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/prnanmia,"You can't prevent pernicious anemia caused by a lack of intrinsic factor. Without intrinsic factor, you won't be able to absorb vitamin B12 and will develop pernicious anemia.
                
Although uncommon, some people develop pernicious anemia because they don't get enough vitamin B12 in their diets. You can take steps to prevent pernicious anemia caused by dietary factors.
                
Eating foods high in vitamin B12 can help prevent low vitamin B12 levels. Good food sources of vitamin B12 include:
                
Breakfast cereals with added vitamin B12
                
Meats such as beef, liver, poultry, and fish
                
Eggs and dairy products (such as milk, yogurt, and cheese)
                
Foods fortified with vitamin B12, such as soy-based beverages and vegetarian burgers
                
If youre a strict vegetarian, talk with your doctor about having your vitamin B12 level checked regularly.
                
Vitamin B12 also is found in multivitamins and B-complex vitamin supplements. Doctors may recommend supplements for people at risk for vitamin B12 deficiency, such as strict vegetarians or people who have had stomach surgery.
                
Older adults may have trouble absorbing vitamin B12. Thus, doctors may recommend that older adults eat foods fortified with vitamin B12 or take vitamin B12 supplements.",prevention,Pernicious Anemia,How to prevent Pernicious Anemia ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/catd,"Treatments for carotid artery disease may include healthy lifestyle changes, medicines, and medical procedures. The goals of treatment are to stop the disease from getting worse and to prevent a stroke. Your treatment will depend on your symptoms, how severe the disease is, and your age and overall health.
                
Heart-Healthy Lifestyle Changes
                
Your doctor may recommend heart-healthy lifestyle changes if you have carotid artery disease. Heart-healthy lifestyle changes include:
                
Heart-healthy eating
                
Maintaining a healthy weight
                
Managing stress
                
Physical activity
                
Quitting smoking
                
Heart-Healthy Eating
                
Your doctor may recommend a heart-healthy eating plan, which should include:
                
Fat-free or low-fat dairy products, such as skim milk
                
Fish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and trout, about twice a week
                
Fruits, such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes
                
Legumes, such as kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans
                
Vegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and carrots
                
Whole grains, such as oatmeal, brown rice, and corn tortillas
                
When following a heart-healthy diet, you should avoid eating:
                
A lot of red meat
                
Palm and coconut oils
                
Sugary foods and beverages
                
Two nutrients in your diet make blood cholesterol levels rise:
                
Saturated fatfound mostly in foods that come from animals
                
Trans fat (trans fatty acids)found in foods made with hydrogenated oils and fats, such as stick margarine; baked goods, such as cookies, cakes, and pies; crackers; frostings; and coffee creamers. Some trans fats also occur naturally in animal fats andmeats.
                
Saturated fat raises your blood cholesterol more than anything else in your diet. When you follow a heart-healthy eating plan, only 5 percent to 6 percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. Food labels list the amounts of saturated fat. To help you stay on track, here are some examples:
                
If you eat:
                
Try to eat no more than:
                
1,200 calories a day                 
                
 8 grams of saturated fat a day      
                
1,500 calories a day
                
10 grams of saturated fat a day
                
1,800 calories a day
                
12 grams of saturated fat a day
                
2,000 calories a day
                
13 grams of saturated fat a day
                
2,500 calories a day
                
17 grams of saturated fat a day
                
Not all fats are bad. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats actually help lower blood cholesterol levels.
                
Some sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are:
                
Avocados
                
Corn, sunflower, and soybean oils
                
Nuts and seeds, such as walnuts
                
Olive, canola, peanut, safflower, and sesame oils
                
Peanut butter
                
Salmon and trout
                
Tofu
                
Sodium
                
You should try to limit the amount of sodium that you eat. This means choosing and preparing foods that are lower in salt and sodium. Try to use low-sodium and no added salt foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. Food labels tell you what you need to know about choosing foods that are lower in sodium. Try to eat no more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium a day. If you have high blood pressure, you may need to restrict your sodium intake even more.
                
Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension
                
Your doctor may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan if you have high blood pressure. The DASH eating plan focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and low in fat, cholesterol, and sodium and salt.
                
The DASH eating plan is a good heart-healthy eating plan, even for those who dont have high blood pressure. Read more about DASH.
                
Alcohol
                
Try to limit alcohol intake. Too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure and triglyceride levels, a type of fat found in the blood. Alcohol also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain.
                
Men should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day. Women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day. One drink is:
                
12 ounces of beer
                
5 ounces of wine
                
1 ounces of liquor
                
Maintaining a Healthy Weight
                
Maintaining a healthy weight is important for overall health and can lower your risk for carotid artery disease. Aim for a Healthy Weight by following a heart-healthy eating plan and keeping physically active.
                
Knowing your body mass index (BMI) helps you find out if youre a healthy weight in relation to your height and gives an estimate of your total body fat. To figure out your BMI, check out the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes (NHLBI) online BMI calculator or talk to your doctor. A BMI:
                
Below 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight.
                
Between 18.5 and 24.9 is in the normal range.
                
Between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight.
                
Of 30 or more is considered obese.
                
A general goal to aim for is a BMI of less than 25. Your doctor or health care provider can help you set an appropriate BMI goal.
                
Measuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. If most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type 2 diabetes. This risk may be high with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. To learn how to measure your waist, visit Assessing Your Weight and Health Risk.
                
If youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. A loss of just 3 percent to 5 percent of your current weight can lower your triglycerides, blood glucose, and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Greater amounts of weight loss can improve blood pressure readings, lower LDL cholesterol, and increase HDL cholesterol.
                
Managing Stress
                
Managing and coping with stress. Learning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health. Consider healthy stress-reducing activities, such as:
                
A stress management program
                
Meditation
                
Physical activity
                
Relaxation therapy
                
Talking things out with friends or family
                
Physical Activity
                
Routine physical activity can lower many risk factors for coronary heart disease, including LDL (bad) cholesterol, high blood pressure, and excess weight. Physical activity also can lower your risk for diabetes and raise your HDL cholesterol level. HDL is the good cholesterol that helps prevent coronary heart disease.
                
Everyone should try to participate in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2hours and 30minutes per week, or vigorous aerobic exercise for 1hour and 15minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats faster and you use more oxygen than usual. The more active you are, the more you will benefit. Participate in aerobic exercise for at least 10minutes at a time spread throughout the week.

Medicines
                
If you have a stroke caused by a blood clot, you may be given a clot-dissolving, or clot-busting, medication. This type of medication must be given within 4 hours of symptom onset. The sooner treatment occurs, the better your chances of recovery. If you think youre having a stroke, call 911 right away for emergency care.
                
Medicines to prevent blood clots are the mainstay treatment for people who have carotid artery disease. They prevent platelets from clumping together and forming blood clots in your carotid arteries, which can lead to a stroke. Two common medications are:
                
Aspirin
                
Clopidogrel
                
Sometimes lifestyle changes alone arent enough to control your cholesterol levels. For example, you also may need statin medications to control or lower your cholesterol. By lowering your blood cholesterol level, you can decrease your chance of having a heart attack or stroke. Doctors usually prescribe statins for people who have:
                
Diabetes
                
Heart disease or have had a stroke
                
High LDL cholesterol levels
                
Doctors may discuss beginning statin treatment with those who have an elevated risk for developing heart disease or having a stroke.
                
You may need other medications to treat diseases and conditions that damage the carotid arteries. Your doctor also may prescribe medications to:
                
Lower your blood pressure.
                
Lower your blood sugar level.
                
Prevent blood clots from forming, which can lead to stroke.
                
Prevent or reduce inflammation.
                
Take all medicines regularly, as your doctor prescribes. Dont change the amount of your medicine or skip a dose unless your doctor tells you to. Your health care team will help find a treatment plan thats right for you.
                
Medical Procedures
                
You may need a medical procedure if you have symptoms caused by the narrowing of the carotid artery. Doctors use one of two methods to open narrowed or blocked carotid arteries: carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery angioplasty and stenting.
                
Carotid Endarterectomy
                
Carotid endarterectomy is mainly for people whose carotid arteries are blocked 50percent ormore.
                
For the procedure, a surgeon will make a cut in your neck to reach the narrowed or blocked carotid artery. Next, he or she will make a cut in the blocked part of the artery and remove the arterys inner lining that is blocking the blood flow.
                
Finally, your surgeon will close the artery with stitches and stop any bleeding. He or she will then close the cut in your neck.
                
Carotid Endarterectomy
                

                
Carotid Artery Angioplasty and Stenting
                
Doctors use a procedure called angioplasty to widen the carotid arteries and restore blood flow to the brain.
                
A thin tube with a deflated balloon on the end is threaded through a blood vessel in your neck to the narrowed or blocked carotid artery. Once in place, the balloon is inflated to push the plaque outward against the wall of the artery.
                
A stent (a small mesh tube) is then put in the artery to support the inner artery wall. The stent also helps prevent the artery from becoming narrowed or blocked again.

NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/pe,"Pulmonary embolism (PE) is treated with medicines, procedures, and other therapies. The main goals of treating PE are to stop the blood clot from getting bigger and keep new clots from forming.
                
Treatment may include medicines to thin the blood and slow its ability to clot. If your symptoms are life threatening, your doctor may give you medicine to quickly dissolve the clot. Rarely, your doctor may use surgery or another procedure to remove the clot.
                
Medicines
                
Anticoagulants (AN-te-ko-AG-u-lants), or blood thinners, decrease your blood's ability to clot. They're used to stop blood clots from getting larger and prevent clots from forming. Blood thinners don't break up blood clots that have already formed. (The body dissolves most clots with time.)
                
You can take blood thinners as either a pill, an injection, or through a needle or tube inserted into a vein (called intravenous, or IV, injection). Warfarin is given as a pill. (Coumadin is a common brand name for warfarin.) Heparin is given as an injection or through an IV tube.
                
Your doctor may treat you with both heparin and warfarin at the same time. Heparin acts quickly. Warfarin takes 2 to 3 days before it starts to work. Once warfarin starts to work, heparin usually is stopped.
                
Pregnant women usually are treated with heparin only, because warfarin is dangerous for the pregnancy.
                
If you have deep vein thrombosis, treatment with blood thinners usually lasts for 3 to 6months. If you've had blood clots before, you may need a longer period of treatment. If you're being treated for another illness, such as cancer, you may need to take blood thinners as long as PE risk factors are present.
                
The most common side effect of blood thinners is bleeding. This can happen if the medicine thins your blood too much. This side effect can be life threatening.
                
Sometimes the bleeding is internal, which is why people treated with blood thinners usually have routine blood tests. These tests, called PT and PTT tests, measure the blood's ability to clot. These tests also help your doctor make sure you're taking the right amount of medicine. Call your doctor right away if you're bruising or bleeding easily.
                
Thrombin inhibitors are a newer type of blood-thinning medicine. They're used to treat some types of blood clots in people who can't take heparin.
                
Emergency Treatment
                
When PE is life threatening, a doctor may use treatments that remove or break up the blood clot. These treatments are given in an emergency room or hospital.
                
Thrombolytics (THROM-bo-LIT-iks) are medicines that can quickly dissolve a blood clot. They're used to treat large clots that cause severe symptoms. Because thrombolytics can cause sudden bleeding, they're used only in life-threatening situations.
                
Sometimes a doctor may use a catheter (a flexible tube) to reach the blood clot. The catheter is inserted into a vein in the groin (upper thigh) or arm and threaded to the clot in the lung. The doctor may use the catheter to remove the clot or deliver medicine to dissolve it.
                
Rarely, surgery may be needed to remove the blood clot.
                
Other Types of Treatment
                
If you can't take medicines to thin your blood, or if the medicines don't work, your doctor may suggest a vena cava filter. This device keeps blood clots from traveling to your lungs.
                
The filter is inserted inside a large vein called the inferior vena cava. (This vein carries blood from the body back to the heart). The filter catches clots before they travel to the lungs. This type of treatment can prevent PE, but it won't stop other blood clots from forming.
                
Graduated compression stockings can reduce the chronic (ongoing) swelling that a blood clot in the leg may cause.
                
Graduated compression stockings are worn on the legs from the arch of the foot to just above or below the knee. These stockings are tight at the ankle and become looser as they go up the leg. This causes gentle compression (pressure) up the leg. The pressure keeps blood from pooling and clotting.",treatment,Pulmonary Embolism,What are the treatments for Pulmonary Embolism ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/pe,"Preventing pulmonary embolism (PE) begins with preventing deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Knowing whether you're at risk for DVT and taking steps to lower your risk are important.
                
Exercise your lower leg muscles if you're sitting for a long time while traveling.
                
Get out of bed and move around as soon as you're able after having surgery or being ill. The sooner you move around, the better your chance is of avoiding a blood clot.
                
Take medicines to prevent clots after some types of surgery (as your doctor prescribes).
                
Follow up with your doctor.
                
If you've already had DVT or PE, you can take more steps to prevent new blood clots from forming. Visit your doctor for regular checkups. Also, use compression stockings to prevent chronic (ongoing) swelling in your legs from DVT (as your doctor advises).

NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/vwd,"Treatment for von Willebrand disease (VWD) is based on the type of VWD you have and how severe it is. Most cases of VWD are mild, and you may need treatment only if you have surgery, tooth extraction, or an accident.
                
Medicines are used to:
                
Increase the amount of von Willebrand factor and factor VIII released into the bloodstream
                
Replace von Willebrand factor
                
Prevent the breakdown of blood clots
                
Control heavy menstrual bleeding in women
                
Specific Treatments
                
One treatment for VWD is a man-made hormone called desmopressin. You usually take this hormone by injection or nasal spray. It makes your body release more von Willebrand factor and factor VIII into your bloodstream. Desmopressin works for most people who have type 1 VWD and for some people who have type 2 VWD.
                
Another type of treatment is von Willebrand factor replacement therapy. This involves an infusion of concentrated von Willebrand factor and factor VIII into a vein in your arm. This treatment may be used if you:
                
Can't take desmopressin or need extended treatment
                
Have type 1 VWD that doesn't respond to desmopressin
                
Have type 2 or type 3 VWD
                
Antifibrinolytic (AN-te-fi-BRIN-o-LIT-ik) medicines also are used to treat VWD. These medicines help prevent the breakdown of blood clots. They're mostly used to stop bleeding after minor surgery, tooth extraction, or an injury. These medicines may be used alone or with desmopressin and replacement therapy.
                
Fibrin glue is medicine that's placed directly on a wound to stop bleeding.
                
Treatments for Women
                
Treatments for women who have VWD with heavy menstrual bleeding include:
                
Birth control pills. The hormones in these pills can increase the amount of von Willebrand factor and factor VIII in your blood. The hormones also can reduce menstrual blood loss. Birth control pills are the most recommended birth control method for women who have VWD.
                
A levonorgestrel intrauterine device. This is a birth control device that contains the hormone progestin. The device is placed in the uterus (womb).
                
Aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid. These antifibrinolytic medicines can reduce bleeding by slowing the breakdown of blood clots.
                
Desmopressin.
                
For some women who are done having children or don't want children, endometrial ablation (EN-do-ME-tre-al ab-LA-shun) is done. This procedure destroys the lining of the uterus. It has been shown to reduce menstrual blood loss in women who have VWD.
                
If you need a hysterectomy (HIS-ter-EK-to-me; surgical removal of the uterus) for another reason, this procedure will stop menstrual bleeding and possibly improve your quality of life. However, hysterectomy has its own risk of bleeding complications.",treatment,Von Willebrand Disease,What are the treatments for Von Willebrand Disease ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/peri,"Most cases of pericarditis are mild; they clear up on their own or with rest and simple treatment. Other times, more intense treatment is needed to prevent complications. Treatment may include medicines and, less often, procedures or surgery.
                
The goals of treatment include:
                
Reducing pain and inflammation
                
Treating the underlying cause, if it's known
                
Checking for complications
                
Specific Types of Treatment
                
As a first step in your treatment, your doctor may advise you to rest until you feel better and have no fever. He or she may tell you to take over-the-counter, anti-inflammatory medicines to reduce pain and inflammation. Examples of these medicines include aspirin and ibuprofen.
                
You may need stronger medicine if your pain is severe. If your pain continues to be severe, your doctor may prescribe a medicine called colchicine and, possibly, prednisone (a steroid medicine).
                
If an infection is causing your pericarditis, your doctor will prescribe an antibiotic or other medicine to treat the infection.
                
You may need to stay in the hospital during treatment for pericarditis so your doctor can check you for complications.
                
The symptoms of acute pericarditis can last from a few days to 3 weeks. Chronic pericarditis may last several months.
                
Other Types of Treatment
                
You may need treatment for complications of pericarditis. Two serious complications are cardiac tamponade and chronic constrictive pericarditis.
                
Cardiac tamponade is treated with a procedure called pericardiocentesis (per-ih-KAR-de-o-sen-TE-sis). A needle or tube (called a catheter) is inserted into the chest wall to remove excess fluid in the pericardium. This procedure relieves pressure on the heart.
                
The only cure for chronic constrictive pericarditis is surgery to remove the pericardium. This is known as a pericardiectomy (PER-i-kar-de-EK-to-me).
                
The treatments for these complications require hospital stays.",treatment,Pericarditis,What are the treatments for Pericarditis ?,Drugs

NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/thrm,"Primary Thrombocythemia
                
This condition is considered less harmful today than in the past, and its outlook often is good. People who have no signs or symptoms don't need treatment, as long as the condition remains stable.
                
Taking aspirin may help people who are at risk for blood clots (aspirin thins the blood). However, talk with your doctor about using aspirin because it can cause bleeding.
                
Doctors prescribe aspirin to most pregnant women who have primary thrombocythemia. This is because it doesn't have a high risk of side effects for the fetus.
                
Some people who have primary thrombocythemia may need medicines or medical procedures to lower their platelet counts.
                
Medicines To Lower Platelet Counts
                
You may need medicines to lower your platelet count if you:
                
Have a history of blood clots or bleeding
                
Have risk factors for heart disease, such as high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, or diabetes
                
Are older than 60
                
Have a platelet count over 1 million
                
You'll need to take these medicines throughout your life.
                
Hydroxyurea. This platelet-lowering medicine is used to treat cancers and other life-threatening diseases. Hydroxyurea most often is given under the care of doctors who specialize in cancer or blood diseases. Patients on hydroxyurea are closely monitored.
                
Currently, hydroxyurea plus aspirin is the standard treatment for people who have primary thrombocythemia and are at high risk for blood clots.
                
Anagrelide. This medicine also has been used to lower platelet counts in people who have thrombocythemia. However, research shows that when compared with hydroxyurea, anagrelide has worse outcomes. Anagrelide also has side effects, such as fluid retention, palpitations (pal-pih-TA-shuns), arrhythmias (ah-RITH-me-ahs), heart failure, and headaches.
                
Interferon alfa. This medicine lowers platelet counts, but 20 percent of patients can't handle its side effects. Side effects include a flu-like feeling, decreased appetite, nausea (feeling sick to the stomach), diarrhea, seizures, irritability, and sleepiness.
                
Doctors may prescribe this medicine to pregnant women who have primary thrombocythemia because it's safer for a fetus than hydroxyurea and anagrelide.
                
Plateletpheresis
                
Plateletpheresis (PLATE-let-fe-REH-sis) is a procedure used to rapidly lower your platelet count. This procedure is used only for emergencies. For example, if you're having a stroke due to primary thrombocythemia, you may need plateletpheresis.
                
An intravenous (IV) needle that's connected to a tube is placed in one of your blood vessels to remove blood. The blood goes through a machine that removes platelets from the blood. The remaining blood is then put back into you through an IV line in one of your blood vessels.
                
One or two procedures might be enough to reduce your platelet count to a safe level.
                
Secondary Thrombocytosis
                
Secondary thrombocytosis is treated by addressing the condition that's causing it.
                
People who have secondary thrombocytosis usually don't need platelet-lowering medicines or procedures. This is because their platelets usually are normal (unlike in primary thrombocythemia).
                
Also, secondary thrombocytosis is less likely than primary thrombocythemia to cause serious problems related to blood clots and bleeding.",treatment,Thrombocythemia and Thrombocytosis,What are the treatments for Thrombocythemia and Thrombocytosis ?,Drugs

NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/chld,"Childhood interstitial lung disease (chILD) is rare, and little research has been done on how to treat it. At this time, chILD has no cure. However, some children who have certain diseases, such as neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia of infancy, may slowly improve over time.
                
Current treatment approaches include supportive therapy, medicines, and, in the most serious cases, lung transplants.
                
Supportive Therapy
                
Supportive therapy refers to treatments that help relieve symptoms or improve quality of life. Supportive approaches used to relieve common chILD symptoms include:
                
Oxygen therapy. If your child's blood oxygen level is low, he or she may need oxygen therapy. This treatment can improve breathing, support growth, and reduce strain on the heart.
                
Bronchodilators. These medications relax the muscles around your childs airways, which helps open the airways and makes breathing easier.
                
Breathing devices. Children who have severe disease may need ventilators or other devices to help them breathe easier.
                
Extra nutrition. This treatment can help improve your child's growth and help him or her gain weight. Close monitoring of growth is especially important.
                
Techniques and devices to help relieve lung congestion. These may include chest physical therapy (CPT) or wearing a vest that helps move mucus (a sticky substance) to the upper airways so it can be coughed up. CPT may involve pounding the chest and back over and over with your hands or a device to loosen mucus in the lungs so that your child can cough it up.
                
Supervised pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). PR is a broad program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic (ongoing) breathing problems.
                
Medicines
                
Corticosteroids are a common treatment for many children who have chILD. These medicines help reduce lung inflammation.
                
Other medicines can help treat specific types or causes of chILD. For example, antimicrobial medicines can treat a lung infection. Acid-blocking medicines can prevent acid reflux, which can lead to aspiration.
                
Lung Transplant
                
A lung transplant may be an option for children who have severe chILD if other treatments haven't worked.
                
Currently, lung transplants are the only effective treatment for some types of chILD that have a high risk of death, such as alveolar capillary dysplasia and certain surfactant dysfunction mutations.
                
Early diagnosis of these diseases gives children the chance to receive lung transplants. So far, chILD doesn't appear to come back in patients' transplanted lungs.

NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/chld,"At this time, most types of childhood interstitial lung disease (chILD) can't be prevented. People who have a family history of inherited (genetic) interstitial lung disease may want to consider genetic counseling. A counselor can explain the risk of children inheriting chILD.
                
You and your child can take steps to help prevent infections and other illnesses that worsen chILD and its symptoms. For example:
                
Make hand washing a family habit to avoid germs and prevent illnesses.
                
Try to keep your child away from people who are sick. Even a common cold can cause problems for someone who has chILD.
                
Talk with your child's doctor about vaccines that your child needs, such as an annual flu shot. Make sure everyone in your household gets all of the vaccines that their doctors recommend.
                
Talk with your child's doctor about how to prevent your child from getting respiratory syncytial (sin-SIT-e-al) virus. This common virus leads to cold and flu symptoms for most people. However, it can make children who have lung diseases very sick.

NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/cf,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) has no cure. However, treatments have greatly improved in recent years. The goals of CF treatment include:
                
Preventing and controlling lung infections
                
Loosening and removing thick, sticky mucus from the lungs
                
Preventing or treating blockages in the intestines
                
Providing enough nutrition
                
Preventing dehydration (a lack of fluid in the body)
                
Depending on the severity of CF, you or your child may be treated in a hospital.
                
Specialists Involved
                
If you or your child has CF, you may be treated by a CF specialist. This is a doctor who is familiar with the complex nature of CF.
                
Often, a CF specialist works with a medical team of nurses, physical therapists, dietitians, and social workers. CF specialists often are located at major medical centers.
                
The United States also has more than 100 CF Care Centers. These centers have teams of doctors, nurses, dietitians, respiratory therapists, physical therapists, and social workers who have special training related to CF care. Most CF Care Centers have pediatric and adult programs or clinics.
                
For more information about CF Care Centers, go to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation's Care Center Network Web page.
                
Treatment for Lung Problems
                
The main treatments for lung problems in people who have CF are chest physical therapy (CPT), exercise, and medicines. Your doctor also may recommend a pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) program.
                
Chest Physical Therapy
                
CPT also is called chest clapping or percussion. It involves pounding your chest and back over and over with your hands or a device to loosen the mucus from your lungs so that you can cough it up.
                
You might sit down or lie on your stomach with your head down while you do CPT. Gravity and force help drain the mucus from your lungs.
                
Some people find CPT hard or uncomfortable to do. Several devices have been developed that may help with CPT, such as:
                
An electric chest clapper, known as a mechanical percussor.
                
An inflatable therapy vest that uses high-frequency airwaves to force the mucus that's deep in your lungs toward your upper airways so you can cough it up.
                
A small, handheld device that you exhale through. The device causes vibrations that dislodge the mucus.
                
A mask that creates vibrations that help break the mucus loose from your airway walls.
                
Breathing techniques also may help dislodge mucus so you can cough it up. These techniques include forcing out a couple of short breaths or deeper breaths and then doing relaxed breathing. This may help loosen the mucus in your lungs and open your airways.
                
Exercise
                
Aerobic exercise that makes you breathe harder can help loosen the mucus in your airways so you can cough it up. Exercise also helps improve your overall physical condition.
                
However, CF causes your sweat to become very salty. As a result, your body loses large amounts of salt when you sweat. Thus, your doctor may recommend a high-salt diet or salt supplements to maintain the balance of minerals in your blood.
                
If you exercise regularly, you may be able to cut back on your CPT. However, you should check with your doctor first.
                
Medicines
                
If you have CF, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics, anti-inflammatory medicines, bronchodilators, or medicines to help clear the mucus. These medicines help treat or prevent lung infections, reduce swelling and open up the airways, and thin mucus. If you have mutations in a gene called G551D, which occurs in about 5 percent of people who have CF, your doctor may prescribe the oral medicine ivacaftor (approved for people with CF who are 6 years of age and older).
                
Antibiotics are the main treatment to prevent or treat lung infections. Your doctor may prescribe oral, inhaled, or intravenous (IV) antibiotics.
                
Oral antibiotics often are used to treat mild lung infections. Inhaled antibiotics may be used to prevent or control infections caused by the bacteria mucoid Pseudomonas. For severe or hard-to-treat infections, you may be given antibiotics through an IV tube (a tube inserted into a vein). This type of treatment may require you to stay in a hospital.
                
Anti-inflammatory medicines can help reduce swelling in your airways due to ongoing infections. These medicines may be inhaled or oral.
                
Bronchodilators help open the airways by relaxing the muscles around them. These medicines are inhaled. They're often taken just before CPT to help clear mucus out of your airways. You also may take bronchodilators before inhaling other medicines into your lungs.
                
Your doctor may prescribe medicines to reduce the stickiness of your mucus and loosen it up. These medicines can help clear out mucus, improve lung function, and prevent worsening lung symptoms.
                
Treatments for Advanced Lung Disease
                
If you have advanced lung disease, you may need oxygen therapy. Oxygen usually is given through nasal prongs or a mask.
                
If other treatments haven't worked, a lung transplant may be an option if you have severe lung disease. A lung transplant is surgery to remove a person's diseased lung and replace it with a healthy lung from a deceased donor.
                
Pulmonary Rehabilitation
                
Your doctor may recommend PR as part of your treatment plan. PR is a broad program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic (ongoing) breathing problems.
                
PR doesn't replace medical therapy. Instead, it's used with medical therapy and may include:
                
Exercise training
                
Nutritional counseling
                
Education on your lung disease or condition and how to manage it
                
Energy-conserving techniques
                
Breathing strategies
                
Psychological counseling and/or group support
                
PR has many benefits. It can improve your ability to function and your quality of life. The program also may help relieve your breathing problems. Even if you have advanced lung disease, you can still benefit from PR.

Treatment for Digestive Problems
                
CF can cause many digestive problems, such as bulky stools, intestinal gas, a swollen belly, severe constipation, and pain or discomfort. Digestive problems also can lead to poor growth and development in children.
                
Nutritional therapy can improve your strength and ability to stay active. It also can improve growth and development in children. Nutritional therapy also may make you strong enough to resist some lung infections. A nutritionist can help you create a nutritional plan that meets your needs.
                
In addition to having a well-balanced diet that's rich in calories, fat, and protein, your nutritional therapy may include:
                
Oral pancreatic enzymes to help you digest fats and proteins and absorb more vitamins.
                
Supplements of vitamins A, D, E, and K to replace the fat-soluble vitamins that your intestines can't absorb.
                
High-calorie shakes to provide you with extra nutrients.
                
A high-salt diet or salt supplements that you take before exercising.
                
A feeding tube to give you more calories at night while you're sleeping. The tube may be threaded through your nose and throat and into your stomach. Or, the tube may be placed directly into your stomach through a surgically made hole. Before you go to bed each night, you'll attach a bag with a nutritional solution to the entrance of the tube. It will feed you while you sleep.
                
Other treatments for digestive problems may include enemas and mucus-thinning medicines to treat intestinal blockages. Sometimes surgery is needed to remove an intestinal blockage.
                
Your doctor also may prescribe medicines to reduce your stomach acid and help oral pancreatic enzymes work better.
                
Treatments for Cystic Fibrosis Complications
                
A common complication of CF is diabetes. The type of diabetes associated with CF often requires different treatment than other types of diabetes.
                
Another common CF complication is the bone-thinning disorder osteoporosis. Your doctor may prescribe medicines that prevent your bones from losing their density.",treatment,Cystic Fibrosis,What are the treatments for Cystic Fibrosis ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/dhd,"Diabetic heart disease (DHD) is treated with lifestyle changes, medicines, and medical procedures. The goals of treating DHD include:
                
Controlling diabetes and any other heart disease risk factors you have, such as unhealthy blood cholesterol levels and high blood pressure
                
Reducing or relieving heart disease symptoms, such as angina (chest pain or discomfort)
                
Preventing or delaying heart disease complications, such as a heart attack
                
Repairing heart and coronary artery damage
                
Following the treatment plan your doctor recommends is very important. Compared with people who don't have diabetes, people who have the disease are at higher risk for heart disease, have additional causes of heart disease, may develop heart disease at a younger age, and may have more severe heart disease.
                
Taking action to manage multiple risk factors helps improve your outlook. The good news is that many lifestyle changes help control multiple risk factors.
                
Lifestyle Changes
                
Following a healthy lifestyle is an important part of treating diabetes and DHD. Some people who have diabetes can manage their blood pressure and blood cholesterol levels with lifestyle changes alone.
                
Following a Healthy Diet
                
A healthy diet includes a variety of vegetables and fruits. It also includes whole grains, fat-free or low-fat dairy products, and protein foods, such as lean meats, poultry without skin, seafood, processed soy products, nuts, seeds, beans, and peas.
                
A healthy diet is low in sodium (salt), added sugars, solid fats, and refined grains. Solid fats are saturated fat and trans fatty acids. Refined grains come from processing whole grains, which results in a loss of nutrients (such as dietary fiber).
                
For more information about following a healthy diet, go to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes (NHLBIs) Your Guide to Lowering Your Blood Pressure With DASH and the U.S. Department of Agricultures ChooseMyPlate.gov Web site. Both resources provide general information about healthy eating.
                
Maintaining a Healthy Weight
                
Controlling your weight helps you control heart disease risk factors. If youre overweight or obese, work with your doctor to create a reasonable weight-loss plan.
                
For more information about losing weight or maintaining your weight, go to the Health Topics Overweight and Obesity article.
                
Being Physically Active
                
Regular physical activity can lower many heart disease risk factors, and it helps control your blood sugar level. Physical activity also can improve how insulin works. (Insulin is a hormone that helps turn glucose into energy.)
                
Generally, adults should do at least 150 minutes (2hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity physical activity each week. You dont have to do the activity all at once. You can break it up into shorter periods of at least 10 minutes each.
                
Talk with your doctor about what types and amounts and physical activity are safe for you. People who have diabetes must be careful to watch their blood sugar levels and avoid injury to their feet during physical activity.
                
For more information about physical activity, go to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' ""2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans,"" the Health Topics Physical Activity and Your Heart article, and the NHLBI's ""Your Guide to Physical Activity and Your Heart.""
                
Quitting Smoking
                
Smoking can damage your blood vessels and raise your risk of heart disease. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke.
                
If you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking.
                
For more information about how to quit smoking, go to the Health Topics Smoking and Your Heart article and the NHLBI's ""Your Guide to a Healthy Heart.""
                
Managing Stress
                
Research shows that strong emotions, such as anger, can trigger a heart attack. Learning how to managestress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health.
                
Medicines
                
Medicines are an important part of treatment for people who have diabetes and for people who have DHD.
                
Medicines can help control blood sugar levels, lower blood pressure, reduce the risk of blood clots, improve blood cholesterol levels, reduce the heart's workload, and treat angina symptoms.
                
Your doctor will prescribe medicines based on your specific needs.
                
Medical Procedures
                
If you have DHD, your doctor may recommend a medical procedure. The type of procedure will depend on the type of heart disease you have.
                
For example, both percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI),also known as coronaryangioplasty, and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) are used to treat coronary heart disease (CHD). Both of these procedures improve blood flow to your heart. PCI also can relieve chest pain. CABG can relieve chest pain and may help prevent a heart attack.
                
If you have heart damage and severe heart failure symptoms, your doctor may recommend a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device or an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD).
                
A CRT device is a type of pacemaker. A pacemaker is a small device that helps control abnormal heart rhythms. Its placed under the skin of the chest or abdomen. A CRT device helps the heart's lower chambers contract at the same time, which may decrease heart failure symptoms.
                
An ICD is similar to a pacemaker. An ICD is a small device thats placed under the skin of the chest or abdomen. The device uses electrical pulses or shocks to help control dangerous heart rhythms.
                
Your doctor also may recommend a pacemaker or ICD to treat diabetic cardiomyopathy. Other types of surgery also are used to treat this type of heart disease.
                
For more information about medical procedures used to treat diabetes-related heart diseases, go to the treatment sections of the Health Topics Coronary Heart Disease, Heart Failure, and Cardiomyopathy articles.
                
Diabetes-Specific Treatment Issues
                
The treatments described above are used for people who have DHD and for people who have heart disease without diabetes. However, some aspects of heart disease treatment differ for people who have diabetes.
                
Treatment for High Blood Pressure and High Blood Cholesterol
                
Treatment for high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol often begins earlier in people who have diabetes than in those who don't. People who have diabetes also may have more aggressive treatment goals.
                
For example, your doctor may prescribe medicines called statins even if your blood cholesterol levels are in the normal range. Your doctor also may prescribe statins if you're older than 40 and have other heart disease risk factors.
                
Target goals for LDL cholesterol (sometimes called ""bad"" cholesterol) and high blood pressure also are lower for people who have diabetes than for those who don't. Studies suggest that most people who have diabetes will need more than one blood pressure medicine to reach their goals.
                
Research also has shown that some people who have diabetes may benefit more from certain blood pressure and cholesterol medicines than from others.
                
One example is a group of cholesterol medicines called bile acid sequestrants (such as cholestyramine). This type of medicine may offer advantages for people who have type 2 diabetes. It appears to improve blood sugar control and lower LDL cholesterol.
                
Treatment for Heart Failure
                
Some studies suggest that certain medicines may have advantages for treating heart failure in people who have diabetes. These medicines include ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, aldosterone antagonists, and beta blockers.
                
Research shows that two blood sugar medicines (insulin and sulfanylureas) don't seem to reduce the risk of heart failure in people who have type 2 diabetes. A third medicine (metformin) shows promise, but research is still ongoing.
                
Heart Attack Prevention
                
Doctors may recommend aspirin for people with diabetes who are at increased risk for heart disease and heart attack. Taken each day, low-dose aspirin may prevent blood clots that can lead to a heart attack.
                
People with diabetes who are at increased risk include most men older than 50 and most women older than 60 who have one or more of the following risk factors:
                
Smoking
                
High blood pressure
                
High blood cholesterol
                
A family history of early heart disease
                
A higher than normal level of protein in their urine
                
Blood Sugar Control
                
Controlling blood sugar levels is good for heart health. For example, controlling blood sugar improves everyday heart function for people who have diabetes and heart failure.",treatment,Diabetic Heart Disease,What are the treatments for Diabetic Heart Disease ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/dhd,"Taking action to control risk factors can help prevent or delay heart disease in people who have diabetes and in those who don't. Your risk of heart disease increases with the number of risk factors you have.
                
One step you can take is to adopt a healthy lifestyle. A healthy lifestyle should be part of a lifelong approach to healthy living. A healthy lifestyle includes:
                
Following a healthy diet
                
Maintaining a healthy weight
                
Being physically active
                
Quitting smoking
                
Managing stress
                
You also should know your family history of diabetes and heart disease. If you or someone in your family has diabetes, heart disease, or both, let your doctor know.
                
Your doctor may prescribe medicines to control certain risk factors, such as high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol. Take all of your medicines exactly as your doctor advises.
                
People who have diabetes also need good blood sugar control. Controlling your blood sugar level is good for heart health. Ask your doctor about the best ways to control your blood sugar level.

Babies with sickle cell disease (SCD) should be referred to a doctor or provider group that has experience taking care of people with this disease. The doctor might be a hematologist (a doctor with special training in blood diseases) or an experienced general pediatrician, internist, or family practitioner.
                
For infants, the first SCD visit should take place before 8 weeks of age.
                
If someone was born in a country that doesnt perform newborn SCD screening, he or she might be diagnosed with SCD later in childhood. These people should also be referred as soon as possible for special SCD care.
                

                

                
Examining the person
                
Giving medicines and immunizations
                
Performing tests
                
Educating families about the disease and what to watch out for
                

                
Preventing Infection
                
In SCD, the spleen doesnt work properly or doesnt work at all. This problem makes people with SCD more likely to get severe infections.
                
Penicillin
                
In children with SCD, taking penicillin two times a day has been shown to reduce the chance of having a severe infection caused by the pneumococcus bacteria. Infants need to take liquid penicillin. Older children can take tablets.
                
Many doctors will stop prescribing penicillin after a child has reached the age of 5. Some prefer to continue this antibiotic throughout life, particularly if a person has hemoglobin SS or hemoglobin S0 thalassemia, since people with SCD are still at risk. All people who have had surgical removal of the spleen, called a splenectomy, or a past infection with pneumococcus should keep taking penicillin throughout life.
                
Immunizations
                
People with SCD should receive all recommended childhood vaccines. They should also receive additional vaccines to prevent other infections.
                
Pneumococcus. Even though all children routinely receive the vaccine against pneumococcus (PCV13), children with SCD should also receive a second kind of vaccine against pneumococcus (PPSV23). This second vaccine is given after 24 months of age and again 5 years later. Adults with SCD who have not received any pneumococcal vaccine should get a dose of the PCV13 vaccine. They should later receive the PPSV23 if they have not already received it or it has been more than 5 years since they did. A person should follow these guidelines even if he or she is still taking penicillin.
                
Influenza. All people with SCD should receive an influenza shot every year at the start of flu season. This should begin at 6 months of age. Only the inactivated vaccine, which comes as a shot, should be used in people with SCD.
                
Meningococcus. A child with SCD should receive this vaccine (Menactra or Menveo) at 2, 4, 6, and 1215 months of age. The child should receive a booster vaccine 3 years after this series of shots, then every 5 years after that.
                
Screening Tests and Evaluations
                
Height, Weight, Blood Pressure, and Oxygen Saturation
                
Doctors will monitor height and weight to be sure that a child is growing properly and that a person with SCD is maintaining a healthy weight.
                
Doctors will also track a persons blood pressure. When a person with SCD has high blood pressure, it needs to be treated promptly because it can increase the risk of stroke.
                
Oxygen saturation testing provides information about how much oxygen the blood is carrying.
                
Blood and Urine Testing
                
People with SCD need to have frequent lab tests.
                
Blood tests help to establish a persons baseline for problems like anemia. Blood testing also helps to show whether a person has organ damage, so that it can be treated early.
                
Urine testing can help to detect early kidney problems or infections.
                
Transcranial Doppler (TCD) Ultrasound Screening
                
Children who have hemoglobin SS or hemoglobin S0 thalassemia and are between the ages of 2 and 16 should have TCD testing once a year.
                
This study can find out whether a child is at higher risk for stroke. When the test is abnormal, regular blood transfusions can decrease the chances of having a stroke.
                
The child is awake during the TCD exam. The test does not hurt at all. The TCD machine uses sound waves to measure blood flow like the ultrasound machine used to examine pregnant women.
                
Eye Examinations
                
An eye doctor, or ophthalmologist, should examine a persons eyes every 12 years from the age of 10 onwards.
                
These exams can detect if there are SCD-related problems of the eye. Regular exams can help doctors find and treat problems early to prevent loss of vision. A person should see his or her doctor right away for any sudden change in vision.
                
Pulmonary Hypertension
                
Doctors have different approaches to screening for pulmonary hypertension. This is because studies have not given clear information as to when and how a person should receive the screening. People with SCD and their caretakers should discuss with their doctor whether screening makes sense for them.
                
Cognitive Screening
                
People with sickle cell disease can develop cognitive (thinking) problems that may be hard to notice early in life.
                
Sometimes these problems are caused by silent strokes that can only be seen with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain.
                
People with SCD should tell their doctors or nurses if they have thinking problems, such as difficulties learning in school, slowed decision making, or trouble organizing their thoughts.
                
People can be referred for cognitive testing. This testing can identify areas in which a person could use extra help.
                
Children with SCD who have thinking problems may qualify for an Individualized Education Program, or IEP. An IEP is a plan that helps students to reach their educational goals. Adults may be able to enroll in vocational rehabilitation programs that can help them with job training.
                
Education and Guidance
                
Doctors and other providers will talk with people who have SCD and their caretakers about complications and also review information at every visit.
                
Because there are a lot of things to discuss, new topics are often introduced as a child or adult reaches an age when that subject is important to know about.
                
Doctors and nurses know that there is a lot of information to learn, and they dont expect people to know everything after one discussion. People with SCD and their families should not be afraid to ask questions.
                
Topics that are usually covered include:
                
Hours that medical staff are available and contact information to use when people with SCD or caretakers have questions
                
A plan for what to do and where to get care if a person has a fever, pain, or other signs of SCD complications that need immediate attention
                
How SCD is inherited and the risk of having a child with SCD
                
The importance of regular medical visits, screening tests, and evaluations
                
How to recognize and manage pain
                
How to palpate (feel) a childs spleen. Because of the risk of splenic sequestration crisis, caretakers should learn how to palpate a childs spleen. They should try to feel for the spleen daily and more frequently when the child is ill. If they feel that the spleen is bigger than usual, they should call the care provider. 
                
Transitioning Care
                
When children with SCD become adolescents or young adults, they often need to transition from a pediatric care team to an adult care team. This period has been shown to be associated with increased hospital admissions and medical problems. There seem to be many reasons for this.
                
Some of the increased risk is directly related to the disease. As people with SCD get older, they often develop more organ damage and more disabilities.
                
The shift in care usually occurs at the same time that adolescents are undergoing many changes in their emotional, social, and academic lives. The transition to more independent self-management may be difficult, and following treatment plans may become less likely.
                
When compared with pediatrics, there are often fewer adult SCD programs available in a given region. This makes it more difficult for a person with SCD to find appropriate doctors, particularly those with whom they feel comfortable.
                
To improve use of regular medical care by people with SCD and to reduce age-related complications, many SCD teams have developed special programs that the make transition easier. Such programs should involve the pediatric and the adult care teams. They should also start early and continue over several years.
                
Managing Some Complications of SCD
                
Acute Pain
                
Each person with SCD should have a home treatment regimen that is best suited to their needs. The providers on the SCD team usually help a person develop a written, tailored care plan. If possible, the person with SCD should carry this plan with them when they go to the emergency room.
                
When an acute crisis is just starting, most doctors will advise the person to drink lots of fluids and to take a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) pain medication, such as ibuprofen. When a person has kidney problems, acetaminophen is often preferred.
                
If pain persists, many people will find that they need a stronger medicine.
                
Combining additional interventions, such as massage, relaxation methods, or a heating pad, may also help.
                
If a person with SCD cannot control the pain at home, he or she should go to an SCD day hospital/outpatient unit or an emergency room to receive additional, stronger medicines and intravenous (IV) fluids.
                
Some people may be able to return home once their pain is under better control. In this case, the doctor may prescribe additional pain medicines for a short course of therapy.
                
People often need to be admitted to the hospital to fully control an acute pain crisis.
                
When taken daily, hydroxyurea has been found to decrease the number and severity of pain episodes.
                
Chronic Pain
                
Sometimes chronic pain results from a complication, such as a leg ulcer or aseptic necrosis of the hip. In this case, doctors try to treat the complication causing the pain.
                
While chronic pain is common in adults with SCD, the cause is often poorly understood. Taking pain medicines daily may help to decrease the pain. Some examples of these medicines include:
                
NSAID drugs, such as ibuprofen
                
Duloxetine
                
Gabapentin
                
Amitriptyline
                
Strong pain medicines, such as opiates
                
Other approaches, such as massage, heat, or acupuncture may be helpful in some cases. Chronic pain often comes with feelings of depression and anxiety. Supportive counseling and, sometimes, antidepressant medicines may help. (See coping and emotional issues.)
                
Severe Anemia
                
People should see their doctors or go to a hospital right away if they develop anemia symptoms from a splenic sequestration crisis or an aplastic crisis. These conditions can be life-threatening, and the person will need careful monitoring and treatment in the hospital. A person also usually needs a blood transfusion.
                
People with SCD and symptoms of severe anemia from other causes should also see a doctor right away.
                
Infections
                
Fever is a medical emergency in SCD. All caretakers of infants and children with SCD should take their child to their doctor or go to a hospital right away when their child has a fever. Adults with SCD should also seek care for fever or other signs of infection.
                
All children and adults who have SCD and a fever (over 38.50 C or 101.30 F) must be seen by a doctor and treated with antibiotics right away.
                
Some people will need to be hospitalized, while others may receive care and follow-up as an outpatient.
                
Acute Chest Syndrome
                
People with SCD and symptoms of acute chest syndrome should see their doctor or go to a hospital right away.
                
They will need to be admitted to the hospital where they should receive antibiotics and close monitoring. They may need oxygen therapy and a blood transfusion.
                
When taken daily, the medicine hydroxyurea has been found to decrease the number and severity of acute chest events.
                
Clinical Stroke
                
People with SCD who have symptoms of stroke should be brought to the hospital right away by an ambulance. If a person is having symptoms of stroke, someone should call 9-1-1.
                
Symptoms of stroke may include:
                
Weakness of an arm or leg on one side of the body
                
Trouble speaking, walking, or understanding
                
Loss of balance
                
Severe headache
                
If imaging studies reveal that the person has had an acute stroke, he or she may need an exchange transfusion. This procedure involves slowly removing an amount of the persons blood and replacing it with blood from a donor who does not have SCD or sickle cell trait. Afterward, the person may need to receive monthly transfusions or other treatments to help to prevent another stroke.
                
Silent Stroke and Cognitive Problems
                
Children and adults with SCD and cognitive problems may be able to get useful help based upon the results of their testing. For instance, children may qualify for an IEP. Adults may be able to enroll in vocational, or job, training programs.
                
Priapism
                
Sometimes, a person may be able to relieve priapism by:
                
Emptying the bladder by urinating
                
Taking medicine
                
Increasing fluid intake
                
Doing light exercise
                
If a person has an episode that lasts for 4 hours or more, he should go to the hospital to see a hematologist and urologist.
                
Pregnancy
                
Pregnant women with SCD are at greater risk for problems. They should always see an obstetrician, or OB, who has experience with SCD and high-risk pregnancies and deliveries.
                
The obstetrician should work with a hematologist or primary medical doctor who is well informed about SCD and its complications.
                
Pregnant women with SCD need more frequent medical visits so that their doctors can follow them closely. The doctor may prescribe certain vitamins and will be careful to prescribe pain medicines that are safe for the baby.
                
A pregnant woman with SCD may need to have one or more blood transfusions during her pregnancy to treat complications, such as worsening anemia or an increased number of pain or acute chest syndrome events.
                
Hydroxyurea
                
What Is Hydroxyurea?
                
Hydroxyurea is an oral medicine that has been shown to reduce or prevent several SCD complications.
                
This medicine was studied in patients with SCD because it was known to increase the amount of fetal hemoglobin (hemoglobin F) in the blood. Increased hemoglobin F provides some protection against the effects of hemoglobin S.
                
Hydroxyurea was later found to have several other benefits for a person with SCD, such as decreasing inflammation.
                
Use in adults. Many studies of adults with hemoglobin SS or hemoglobin S thalassemia showed that hydroxyurea reduced the number of episodes of pain crises and acute chest syndrome. It also improved anemia and decreased the need for transfusions and hospital admissions.
                
Use in children. Studies in children with severe hemoglobin SS or S thalassemia showed that hydroxyurea reduced the number of vaso-occlusive crises and hospitalizations. A study of very young children (between the ages of 9 and 18 months) with hemoglobin SS or hemoglobin S thalassemia also showed that hydroxyurea decreased the number of episodes of pain and dactylitis.
                
Who Should Use Hydroxyurea?
                
Since hydroxyurea can decrease several complications of SCD, most experts recommend that children and adults with hemoglobin SS or S0 thalassemia who have frequent painful episodes, recurrent chest crises, or severe anemia take hydroxyurea daily.
                
Some experts offer hydroxyurea to all infants over 9 months of age and young children with hemoglobin SS or S0 thalassemia, even if they do not have severe clinical problems, to prevent or reduce the chance of complications. There is no information about how safe or effective hydroxyurea is in children under 9 months of age.
                
Some experts will prescribe hydroxyurea to people with other types of SCD who have severe, recurrent pain. There is little information available about how effective hydroxyurea is for these types of SCD.
                
In all situations, people with SCD should discuss with their doctors whether or not hydroxyurea is an appropriate medication for them.
                
Pregnant women should not use hydroxyurea.
                
How Is Hydroxyurea Taken?
                
To work properly, hydroxyurea should be taken by mouth daily at the prescribed dose. When a person does not take it regularly, it will not work as well, or it wont work at all.
                
A person with SCD who is taking hydroxyurea needs careful monitoring. This is particularly true in the early weeks of taking the medicine. Monitoring includes regular blood testing and dose adjustments.
                
What Are the Risks of Hydroxyurea?
                
Hydroxyurea can cause the bloods white cell count or platelet count to drop. In rare cases, it can worsen anemia. These side effects usually go away quickly if a person stops taking the medication. When a person restarts it, a doctor usually prescribes a lower dose.
                
Other short-term side effects are less common.
                
It is still unclear whether hydroxyurea can cause problems later in life in people with SCD who take it for many years. Studies so far suggest that it does not put people at a higher risk of cancer and does not affect growth in children. But further studies are needed.
                
Red Blood Cell Transfusions
                
Doctors may use acute and chronic red blood cell transfusions to treat and prevent certain SCD complications. The red blood cells in a transfusion have normal hemoglobin in them.
                
A transfusion helps to raise the number of red blood cells and provides normal red blood cells that are more flexible than red blood cells with sickle hemoglobin. These cells live longer in the circulation. Red blood cell transfusions decrease vaso-occlusion (blockage in the blood vessel) and improve oxygen delivery to the tissues and organs.
                
Acute Transfusion in SCD
                
Doctors use blood transfusions in SCD for complications that cause severe anemia. They may also use them when a person has an acute stroke, in many cases of acute chest crises, and in multi-organ failure.
                
A person with SCD usually receives blood transfusions before surgery to prevent SCD-related complications afterwards.
                
Chronic Transfusion
                
Doctors recommend regular or ongoing blood transfusions for people who have had an acute stroke, since transfusions decrease the chances of having another stroke.
                
Doctors also recommend chronic blood transfusions for children who have abnormal TCD ultrasound results because transfusions can reduce the chance of having a first stroke.
                
Some doctors use this approach to treat complications that do not improve with hydroxyurea. They may also use transfusions in people who have too many side effects from hydroxyurea.
                
What Are the Risks of Transfusion Therapy?
                
Possible complications include:
                
Hemolysis
                
Iron overload, particularly in people receiving chronic transfusions (can severely impair heart and lung function)
                
Infection
                
Alloimmunization (can make it hard to find a matching unit of blood for a future transfusion)
                
All blood banks and hospital personnel have adopted practices to reduce the risk of transfusion problems.
                
People with SCD who receive transfusions should be monitored for and immunized against hepatitis. They should also receive regular screenings for iron overload. If a person has iron overload, the doctor will give chelation therapy, a medicine to reduce the amount of iron in the body and the problems that iron overload causes.
                

                
Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation
                
At the present time, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only cure for SCD. People with SCD and their families should ask their doctor about this procedure.
                
What Are Stem Cells?
                
Stem cells are special cells that can divide over and over again. After they divide, these cells can go on to become blood red cells, white cells, or platelets.
                
A person with SCD has stem cells that make red blood cells that can sickle. People without SCD have stem cells that make red cells that usually wont sickle.
                
What Stem Cells Are Used in HSCT?
                
In HSCT, stem cells are taken from the bone marrow or blood of a person who does not have sickle cell disease (the donor). The donor, however, may have sickle cell trait.
                
The donor is often the persons sister or brother. This is because the safest and most successful transplants use stem cells that are matched for special proteins called HLA antigens. Since these antigens are inherited from parents, a sister or brother is the most likely person to have the same antigens as the person with SCD.
                
What Happens During HSCT?
                
First, stem cells are taken from the donor. After this, the person with SCD (the recipient) is treated with drugs that destroy or reduce his or her own bone marrow stem cells.
                
The donor stem cells are then injected into the persons vein. The injected cells will make a home in the recipients bone marrow, gradually replacing the recipients cells. The new stem cells will make red cells that do not sickle.
                
Which People Receive HSCT?
                
At the present time, most SCD transplants are performed in children who have had complications such as strokes, acute chest crises, and recurring pain crises. These transplants usually use a matched donor.
                
Because only about 1 in 10 children with SCD has a matched donor without SCD in their families, the number of people with SCD who get transplants is low.
                
HSCT is more risky in adults, and that is why most transplants are done in children.
                
There are several medical centers that are researching new SCD HSCT techniques in children and adults who dont have a matched donor in the family or are older than most recipients. Hopefully, more people with SCD will be able to receive a transplant in the future, using these new methods.
                
What Are the Risks?
                
HSCT is successful in about 85 percent of children when the donor is related and HLA matched. Even with this high success rate, HSCT still has risks.
                
Complications can include severe infections, seizures, and other clinical problems. About 5 percent of people have died. Sometimes transplanted cells attack the recipients organs (graft versus host disease).

NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/aat,"Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency has no cure, but its related lung diseases have many treatments. Most of these treatments are the same as the ones used for a lung disease called COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).
                
If you have symptoms related to AAT deficiency, your doctor may recommend:
                
Medicines called inhaled bronchodilators (brong-ko-di-LA-tors) and inhaled steroids. These medicines help open your airways and make breathing easier. They also are used to treat asthma and COPD.
                
Flu and pneumococcal (noo-mo-KOK-al) vaccines to protect you from illnesses that could make your condition worse. Prompt treatment of lung infections also can help protect your lungs.
                
Pulmonary rehabilitation (rehab). Rehab involves treatment by a team of experts at a special clinic. In rehab, you'll learn how to manage your condition and function at your best.
                
Extra oxygen, if needed.
                
A lung transplant. A lung transplant may be an option if you have severe breathing problems. If you have a good chance of surviving the transplant surgery, you may be a candidate for it.
                
Augmentation (og-men-TA-shun) therapy is a treatment used only for people who have AAT-related lung diseases. This therapy involves getting infusions of the AAT protein. The infusions raise the level of the protein in your blood and lungs.
                
Not enough research has been done to show how well this therapy works. However, some research suggests that this therapy may slow the development of AAT deficiency in people who don't have severe disease.
                
People who have AAT deficiency and develop related liver or skin diseases will be referred to doctors who treat those diseases.
                
Future Treatments
                
Researchers are working on possible treatments that will target the faulty AAT genes and replace them with healthy genes. These treatments are in the early stages of development.
                
Researchers also are studying therapies that will help misshapen AAT proteins move from the liver into the bloodstream. They're also studying a type of augmentation therapy in which the AAT protein is inhaled instead of injected into a vein.
                
If you're interested in new treatments, ask your doctor about ongoing clinical trials for AAT deficiency.",treatment,Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency,What are the treatments for Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/aat,"You can't prevent alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency because the condition is inherited (passed from parents to children through genes).
                
If you inherit two faulty AAT genes, you'll have AAT deficiency. Even so, you may never develop one of the diseases related to the condition.
                
You can take steps to prevent or delay lung diseases related to AAT deficiency. One important step is to quit smoking. If you don't smoke, don't start.
                
Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. If you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking.
                
For more information about how to quit smoking, go to the Health Topics Smoking and Your Heart article and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's ""Your Guide to a Healthy Heart."" Although these resources focus on heart health, they include basic information about how to quit smoking.
                
Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke and places with dust, fumes, or other toxic substances that you may inhale.
                
Check your living and working spaces for things that may irritate your lungs. Examples include flower and tree pollen, ash, allergens, air pollution, wood burning stoves, paint fumes, and fumes from cleaning products and other household items.
                
If you have a lung disease related to AAT deficiency, ask your doctor whether you might benefit from augmentation therapy. This is a treatment in which you receive infusions of AAT protein.

NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/pcd,"Unfortunately, no treatment is available yet to fix faulty airway cilia. (Cilia are tiny, hair-like structures that line the airways.) Thus, treatment for primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) focuses on which symptoms and complications you have.
                
The main goals of treating PCD are to:
                
Control and treat lung, sinus, and ear infections
                
Remove trapped mucus from the lungs and airways
                
Specialists Involved
                
Many doctors may help care for someone who has PCD. For example, a neonatologist may suspect PCD or another lung disorder if a newborn has breathing problems at birth. A neonatologist is a doctor who specializes in treating newborns.
                
A pediatrician may suspect PCD if a child has chronic (ongoing) sinus, ear, and/or lung infections. A pediatrician is a doctor who specializes in treating children. This type of doctor provides children with ongoing care from an early age and treats conditions such as ear infections and breathing problems.
                
An otolaryngologist also may help diagnose and treat PCD. This type of doctor treats ear, nose, and throat disorders and also is called an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist. If a child has chronic sinus or ear infections, an ENT specialist may be involved in the child's care.
                
A pulmonologist may help diagnose or treat lung problems related to PCD. This type of doctor specializes in diagnosing and treating lung diseases and conditions. Most people who have PCD have lung problems at some point in their lives.
                
A pathologist is a doctor who specializes in identifying diseases by studying cells and tissues under a microscope. This type of doctor may help diagnose PCD by looking at cilia under a microscope.
                
A pathologist also may look at mucus samples to see what types of bacteria are causing infections. This information can help your doctor decide which treatments to prescribe.
                
Treatments for Breathing and Lung Problems
                
Standard treatments for breathing and lung problems in people who have PCD are chest physical therapy (CPT), exercise, and medicines.
                
One of the main goals of these treatments is to get you to cough. Coughing clears mucus from the airways, which is important for people who have PCD. For this reason, your doctor also may advise you to avoid medicines that suppress coughing.
                
Chest Physical Therapy
                
CPT also is called chest clapping or percussion. It involves pounding your chest and back over and over with your hands or a device to loosen the mucus from your lungs so that you can cough it up.
                
You might sit down or lie on your stomach with your head down while you do CPT. Gravity and force help drain the mucus from your lungs.
                
Some people find CPT hard or uncomfortable to do. Several devices have been made to help with CPT, such as:
                
An electric chest clapper, known as a mechanical percussor.
                
An inflatable therapy vest that uses high-frequency airwaves. The airwaves force the mucus that's deep in your lungs toward your upper airways so you can cough it up.
                
A small hand-held device that you breathe out through. The device causes vibrations that dislodge the mucus.
                
A mask that creates vibrations to help break the mucus loose from your airway walls.
                
Breathing techniques also may help dislodge mucus so you can cough it up. These techniques include forcing out a couple of short breaths or deeper breaths and then doing relaxed breathing. This may help loosen the mucus in your lungs and open your airways.
                
Exercise
                
Aerobic exercise that makes you breathe harder helps loosen the mucus in your airways so you can cough it up. Exercise also helps improve your overall physical condition.
                
Talk with your doctor about what types and amounts of exercise are safe for you or your child.
                
Medicines
                
If you have PCD, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics, bronchodilators, or anti-inflammatory medicines. These medicines help treat lung infections, open up the airways, and reduce swelling.
                
Antibiotics are the main treatment to prevent or treat lung infections. Your doctor may prescribe oral or intravenous (IV) antibiotics.
                
Oral antibiotics often are used to treat mild lung infections. For severe or hard-to-treat infections, you may be given IV antibiotics through a tube inserted into a vein.
                
To help decide which antibiotics you need, your doctor may send mucus samples to a pathologist. The pathologist will try to find out which bacteria are causing the infection.
                
Bronchodilators help open the airways by relaxing the muscles around them. You inhale these medicines. Often, they're taken just before CPT to help clear mucus from your lungs. You also may take bronchodilators before inhaling other medicines into your lungs.
                
Anti-inflammatory medicines can help reduce swelling in your airways that's caused by ongoing infections. These medicines may be inhaled or oral.
                
Treatments for Sinus and Ear Infections
                
To treat infections, your doctor may recommend saline nasal washes and anti-inflammatory nasal spray. If these treatments aren't enough, you may need medicines, such as antibiotics. If antibiotics don't work, surgery may be an option.
                
Tympanostomy (tim-pan-OS-toe-me) is a procedure in which small tubes are inserted into the eardrums to help drain mucus from the ears. This procedure may help children who have hearing problems caused by PCD.
                
Nasal or sinus surgery may help drain the sinuses and provide short-term relief of symptoms. However, the long-term benefits of this treatment are unclear.
                
Treatments for Advanced Lung Disease
                
People who have PCD may develop a serious lung condition called bronchiectasis. This condition often is treated with medicines, hydration (drinking plenty of fluids), and CPT.
                
If bronchiectasis severely affects part of your lung, surgery may be used to remove that area of lung.
                
In very rare cases, if other treatments haven't worked, lung transplant may be an option for severe lung disease. A lung transplant is surgery to remove a person's diseased lung and replace it with a healthy lung from a deceased donor.",treatment,Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia,What are the treatments for Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia ?,Drugs

If you have second-degree heart block, you may need a pacemaker. A pacemaker is a small device that's placed under the skin of your chest or abdomen. This device uses electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate.
                
If you have third-degree heart block, you will need a pacemaker. In an emergency, a temporary pacemaker might be used until you can get a long-term device. Most people who have third-degree heart block need pacemakers for the rest of their lives.
                
Some people who have third-degree congenital heart block don't need pacemakers for many years. Others may need pacemakers at a young age or during infancy.
                
If a pregnant woman has an autoimmune disease, such as lupus, her fetus is at risk for heart block. If heart block is detected in a fetus, the mother might be given medicine to reduce the fetus' risk of developing serious heart block.
                
Sometimes acquired heart block goes away if the factor causing it is treated or resolved. For example, heart block that occurs after a heart attack or surgery may go away during recovery.

NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/vas,"Treatment for vasculitis will depend on the type of vasculitis you have, which organs are affected, and the severity of the condition.
                
People who have severe vasculitis are treated with prescription medicines. Rarely, surgery may be done. People who have mild vasculitis may find relief with over-the-counter pain medicines, such as acetaminophen, aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen.
                
The main goal of treating vasculitis is to reduce inflammation in the affected blood vessels. This usually is done by reducing or stopping the immune response that caused the inflammation.
                
Types of Treatment
                
Common prescription medicines used to treat vasculitis include corticosteroids and cytotoxic medicines.
                
Corticosteroids help reduce inflammation in your blood vessels. Examples of corticosteroids are prednisone, prednisolone, and methylprednisolone.
                
Doctors may prescribe cytotoxic medicines if vasculitis is severe or if corticosteroids don't work well. Cytotoxic medicines kill the cells that are causing the inflammation. Examples of these medicines are azathioprine, methotrexate, and cyclophosphamide.
                
Your doctor may prescribe both corticosteroids and cytotoxic medicines.
                
Other treatments may be used for certain types of vasculitis. For example, the standard treatment for Kawasaki disease is high-dose aspirin and immune globulin. Immune globulin is a medicine thats injected into a vein.
                
Certain types of vasculitis may require surgery to remove aneurysms that have formed as a result of the condition. (An aneurysm is an abnormal bulge in the wall of a blood vessel.)",treatment,Vasculitis,What are the treatments for Vasculitis ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/vas,"You can't prevent vasculitis. However, treatment can help prevent or delay the complications of vasculitis.
                
People who have severe vasculitis are treated with prescription medicines. Rarely, surgery may be done. People who have mild vasculitis may find relief with over-the-counter pain medicines, such as acetaminophen, aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen.

NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/atherosclerosis,"Treatments for atherosclerosis may include heart-healthy lifestyle changes, medicines, and medical procedures or surgery. The goals of treatment include:
                
Lowering the risk of blood clots forming
                
Preventing atherosclerosis-related diseases
                
Reducing risk factors in an effort to slow or stop the buildup of plaque
                
Relieving symptoms
                
Widening or bypassing plaque-clogged arteries
                
Heart-Healthy Lifestyle Changes
                
Your doctor may recommend heart-healthy lifestyle changes if you have atherosclerosis. Heart-healthy lifestyle changes include heart-healthy eating, maintaining a healthy weight, managing stress, physical activity and quitting smoking.
                
Heart-Healthy Eating
                
Your doctor may recommend heart-healthy eating, which should include:
                
Fat-free or low-fat dairy products, such as skim milk
                
Fish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and trout, about twice a week
                
Fruits, such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes
                
Legumes, such as kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans
                
Vegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and carrots
                
Whole grains, such as oatmeal, brown rice, and corn tortillas
                
When following a heart-healthy diet, you should avoid eating:
                
A lot of red meat
                
Palm and coconut oils
                
Sugary foods and beverages
                
Two nutrients in your diet make blood cholesterol levels rise:
                
Saturated fatfound mostly in foods that come from animals
                
Trans fat (trans fatty acids)found in foods made with hydrogenated oils and fats, such as stick margarine; baked goods, such as cookies, cakes, and pies; crackers; frostings; and coffee creamers. Some trans fats also occur naturally in animal fats and meats.
                
Saturated fat raises your blood cholesterol more than anything else in your diet. When you follow a heart-healthy eating plan, only 5 percent to 6 percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. Food labels list the amounts of saturated fat. To help you stay on track, here are some examples:
                
1,200 calories a day
                
8 grams of saturated fat a day
                
1,500 calories a day
                
10 grams of saturated fat a day
                
1,800 calories a day
                
12 grams of saturated fat a day
                
2,000 calories a day
                
13 grams of saturated fat a day
                
2,500 calories a day
                
17 grams of saturated fat a day
                
Not all fats are bad. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats actually help lower blood cholesterol levels. Some sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are:
                
Avocados
                
Corn, sunflower, and soybean oils
                
Nuts and seeds, such as walnuts
                
Olive, canola, peanut, safflower, and sesame oils
                
Peanut butter
                
Salmon and trout
                
Tofu
                
Sodium
                
You should try to limit the amount of sodium that you eat. This means choosing and preparing foods that are lower in salt and sodium. Try to use low-sodium and no added salt foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. Food labels tell you what you need to know about choosing foods that are lower in sodium. Try to eat no more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium a day. If you have high blood pressure, you may need to restrict your sodium intake even more.
                
Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension
                
Your doctor may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan if you have high blood pressure. The DASH eating plan focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and low in fat, cholesterol, and sodium and salt.
                
The DASH eating plan is a good heart-healthy eating plan, even for those who dont have high blood pressure. Read more about DASH.
                
Alcohol
                
Try to limit alcohol intake. Too much alcohol will raise your blood pressure and triglyceride levels, a type of fat found in the blood. Alcohol also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain.
                
Men should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day. Women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day. One drink is:
                
12 ounces of beer
                
5 ounces of wine
                
1 ounces of liquor
                
Maintaining a Healthy Weight
                
Maintaining a healthy weight is important for overall health and can lower your risk for coronary heart disease. Aim for a Healthy Weight by following a heart-healthy eating plan and keeping physically active.
                
Knowing your body mass index (BMI) helps you find out if youre a healthy weight in relation to your height and gives an estimate of your total body fat. To figure out your BMI, check out the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes online BMI calculator or talk to your doctor. A BMI:
                
Below 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight.
                
Between 18.5 and 24.9 is in the normal range.
                
Between 25.0 and 29.9 is considered overweight.
                
A BMI of 30.0 or higher is considered obese.
                
A general goal to aim for is a BMI of less than 25. Your doctor or health care provider can help you set an appropriate BMI goal.
                
Measuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. If most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type2 diabetes. This risk may be high with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. To learn how to measure your waist, visit Assessing Your Weight and Health Risk. For more information about losing weight or maintaining your weight, visit Aim for a Healthy Weight.
                
If youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. A loss of just 3 percent to 5 percent of your current weight can lower your triglycerides, blood glucose, and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Greater amounts of weight loss can improve blood pressure readings, lower LDL cholesterol, and increase HDL cholesterol.
                
Managing Stress
                
Learning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health. Consider healthy stress-reducing activities, such as:
                
A stress management program
                
Meditation
                
Physical activity
                
Relaxation therapy
                
Talking things out with friends or family
                
Physical Activity
                
Regular physical activity can lower many atherosclerosis risk factors, including LDL or bad cholesterol, high blood pressure, and excess weight. Physical activity also can lower your risk for diabetes and raise your HDL or good cholesterol, which helps prevent atherosclerosis.
                
Everyone should try to participate in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2 hours and 30 minutes per week or vigorous aerobic exercise for 1 hour and 15 minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats faster and you use more oxygen than usual. The more active you are, the more you will benefit. Participate in aerobic exercise for at least 10minutes at a time spread throughout the week.
                
Talk with your doctor before you start a new exercise plan. Ask your doctor how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you. Read more about physical activity at:

Quitting Smoking
                
If you smoke or use tobacco, quit. Smoking can damage and tighten blood vessels and raise your risk for atherosclerosis. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke. If you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking.
                
For more information about how to quit smoking, visit Smoking and Your Heart.
                
Medicines
                
Sometimes lifestyle changes alone arent enough to control your cholesterol levels. For example, you also may need statin medications to control or lower your cholesterol. By lowering your blood cholesterol level, you can decrease your chance of having a heart attack or stroke. Doctors usually prescribe statins for people who have:
                
Coronary heart disease, peripheral artery disease, or had a prior stroke
                
Diabetes
                
High LDL cholesterol levels
                
Doctors may discuss beginning statin treatment with people who have an elevated risk for developing heart disease or having a stroke. Your doctor also may prescribe other medications to:
                
Lower your blood pressure
                
Lower your blood sugar levels
                
Prevent blood clots, which can lead to heart attack and stroke
                
Prevent inflammation
                
Take all medicines regularly, as your doctor prescribes. Dont change the amount of your medicine or skip a dose unless your doctor tells you to. You should still follow a heart healthy lifestyle, even if you take medicines to treat your atherosclerosis.
                
Medical Procedures and Surgery
                
If you have severe atherosclerosis, your doctor may recommend a medical procedure or surgery.
                
Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), also known as coronary angioplasty, is a procedure thats used to open blocked or narrowed coronary (heart) arteries. PCI can improve blood flow to the heart and relieve chest pain. Sometimes a small mesh tube called a stent is placed in the artery to keep it open after the procedure.
                
Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is a type of surgery. In CABG, arteries or veins from other areas in your body are used to bypass or go around your narrowed coronary arteries. CABG can improve blood flow to your heart, relieve chest pain, and possibly prevent a heart attack.
                
Bypass grafting also can be used for leg arteries. For this surgery, a healthy blood vessel is used to bypass a narrowed or blocked artery in one of the legs. The healthy blood vessel redirects blood around the blocked artery, improving blood flow to the leg.
                
Carotid endarterectomy is a type of surgery to remove plaque buildup from the carotid arteries in the neck. This procedure restores blood flow to the brain, which can help prevent a stroke.",treatment,Atherosclerosis,What are the treatments for Atherosclerosis ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/atherosclerosis,"Taking action to control your risk factors can help prevent or delay atherosclerosis and its related diseases. Your risk for atherosclerosis increases with the number of risk factors youhave.
                
One step you can take is to adopt a healthy lifestyle, which can include:
                
Heart-Healthy Eating. Adopt heart-healthy eating habits, which include eating different fruits and vegetables (including beans and peas), whole grains, lean meats, poultry without skin, seafood, and fat-free or low-fat milk and dairy products. A heart-healthy diet is low in sodium, added sugar, solid fats, and refined grains. Following a heart-healthy diet is an important part of a healthy lifestyle.
                
Physical Activity. Be as physically active as you can. Physical activity can improve your fitness level and your health. Ask your doctor what types and amounts of activity are safe for you. Read more about Physical Activity and Your Heart.
                
Quit Smoking. If you smoke, quit. Smoking can damage and tighten blood vessels and raise your risk for atherosclerosis. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke. Read more about Smoking and Your Heart.
                
Weight Control. If youre overweight or obese, work with your doctor to create a reasonable weight-loss plan. Controlling your weight helps you control risk factors foratherosclerosis.
                
Other steps that can prevent or delay atherosclerosis include knowing your family history of atherosclerosis. If you or someone in your family has an atherosclerosis-related disease, be sure to tell your doctor.
                
If lifestyle changes arent enough, your doctor may prescribe medicines to control your atherosclerosis risk factors. Take all of your medicines as your doctor advises.",prevention,Atherosclerosis,How to prevent Atherosclerosis ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis,"Doctors may prescribe medicines, oxygen therapy, pulmonary rehabilitation (PR), and lung transplant to treat idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).
                
Medicines
                
Currently, no medicines are proven to slow the progression of IPF.
                
Prednisone, azathioprine (A-zah-THI-o-preen), and N-acetylcysteine (a-SEH-til-SIS-tee-in) have been used to treat IPF, either alone or in combination. However, experts have not found enough evidence to support their use.
                
Prednisone
                
Prednisone is an anti-inflammatory medicine. You usually take it by mouth every day. However, your doctor may give it to you through a needle or tube inserted into a vein in your arm for several days. After that, you usually take it by mouth.
                
Because prednisone can cause serious side effects, your doctor may prescribe it for 3 to 6 months or less at first. Then, if it works for you, your doctor may reduce the dose over time and keep you on it longer.
                
Azathioprine
                
Azathioprine suppresses your immune system. You usually take it by mouth every day. Because it can cause serious side effects, your doctor may prescribe it with prednisone for only 3 to 6 months.
                
If you don't have serious side effects and the medicines seem to help you, your doctor may keep you on them longer.
                
N-acetylcysteine
                
N-acetylcysteine is an antioxidant that may help prevent lung damage. You usually take it by mouth several times a day.
                
A common treatment for IPF is a combination of prednisone, azathioprine, and N-acetylcysteine. However, this treatment was recently found harmful in a study funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).
                
If you have IPF and take this combination of medicines, talk with your doctor. Do not stop taking the medicines on your own.
                
The NHLBI currently supports research to compare N-acetylcysteine treatment with placebo treatment (sugar pills) in patients who have IPF.
                
New Medicines Being Studied
                
Researchers, like those in the Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Network, are studying new treatments for IPF. With the support and guidance of the NHLBI, these researchers continue to look for new IPF treatments and therapies.
                
Some of these researchers are studying medicines that may reduce inflammation and prevent or reduce scarring caused by IPF.
                
If you're interested in joining a research study, talk with your doctor. For more information about ongoing research, go to the ""Clinical Trials"" section of this article.
                
Other Treatments
                
Other treatments that may help people who have IPF include the following:
                
Flu andpneumonia vaccines may help prevent infections and keep you healthy.
                
Cough medicines or oral codeine may relieve coughing.
                
Vitamin D, calcium, and a bone-building medicine may help prevent bone loss if you're taking prednisone or another corticosteroid.
                
Anti-reflux therapy may help control gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Most people who have IPF also have GERD.
                
Oxygen Therapy
                
If the amount of oxygen in your blood gets low, you may need oxygen therapy. Oxygen therapy can help reduce shortness of breath and allow you to be more active.
                
Oxygen usually is given through nasal prongs or a mask. At first, you may need it only during exercise and sleep. As your disease worsens, you may need it all the time.
                
For more information, go to the Health Topics Oxygen Therapy article.
                
Pulmonary Rehabilitation
                
PR is now a standard treatment for people who have chronic (ongoing) lung disease. PR is a broad program that helps improve the well-being of people who have breathing problems.
                
The program usually involves treatment by a team of specialists in a special clinic. The goal is to teach you how to manage your condition and function at your best.
                
PR doesn't replace medical therapy. Instead, it's used with medical therapy and may include:
                
Exercise training
                
Nutritional counseling
                
Education on your lung disease or condition and how to manage it

For more information, go to the Health Topics Pulmonary Rehabilitation article.
                
Lung Transplant
                
Your doctor may recommend a lung transplant if your condition is quickly worsening or very severe. A lung transplant can improve your quality of life and help you live longer.
                
Some medical centers will consider patients older than 65 for lung transplants if they have no other serious medical problems.
                
The major complications of a lung transplant are rejection and infection. (""Rejection"" refers to your body creating proteins that attack the new organ.) You will have to take medicines for the rest of your life to reduce the risk of rejection.
                
Because the supply of donor lungs is limited, talk with your doctor about a lung transplant as soon as possible.

NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/brnchi,"The main goals of treating acute and chronic bronchitis are to relieve symptoms and make breathing easier.
                
If you have acute bronchitis, your doctor may recommend rest, plenty of fluids, and aspirin (for adults) or acetaminophen to treat fever.
                
Antibiotics usually aren't prescribed for acute bronchitis. This is because they don't work against virusesthe most common cause of acute bronchitis. However, if your doctor thinks you have a bacterial infection, he or she may prescribe antibiotics.
                
A humidifier or steam can help loosen mucus and relieve wheezing and limited air flow. If your bronchitis causes wheezing, you may need an inhaled medicine to open your airways. You take this medicine using an inhaler. This device allows the medicine to go straight to your lungs.
                
Your doctor also may prescribe medicines to relieve or reduce your cough and treat your inflamed airways (especially if your cough persists).
                
If you have chronic bronchitis and also have been diagnosed with COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), you may need medicines to open your airways and help clear away mucus. These medicines include bronchodilators (inhaled) and steroids (inhaled or pill form).
                
If you have chronic bronchitis, your doctor may prescribe oxygen therapy. This treatment can help you breathe easier, and it provides your body with needed oxygen.
                
One of the best ways to treat acute and chronic bronchitis is to remove the source of irritation and damage to your lungs. If you smoke, it's very important to quit.
                
Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Try to avoid secondhand smoke and other lung irritants, such as dust, fumes, vapors, and air pollution.

NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/ttp,"Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) can be fatal or cause lasting damage, such as brain damage or a stroke, if it's not treated right away.
                
In most cases, TTP occurs suddenly and lasts for days or weeks, but it can go on for months. Relapses (flareups) can occur in up to 60 percent of people who have acquired TTP. Flareups also occur in most people who have inherited TTP.
                
Plasma treatments are the most common way to treat TTP. Other treatments include medicines and surgery. Treatments are done in a hospital.
                
Plasma Therapy
                
Plasma is the liquid part of your blood. It carries blood cells, hormones, enzymes, and nutrients to your body.
                
TTP is treated with plasma therapy. This includes:
                
Fresh frozen plasma for people who have inherited TTP
                
Plasma exchange for people who have acquired TTP
                
Plasma therapy is started in the hospital as soon as TTP is diagnosed or suspected.
                
For inherited TTP, fresh frozen plasma is given through an intravenous (IV) line inserted into a vein. This is done to replace the missing or changed ADAMTS13 enzyme.
                
Plasma exchange (also called plasmapheresis) is used to treat acquired TTP. This is a lifesaving procedure. It removes antibodies (proteins) from the blood that damage your ADAMTS13 enzyme. Plasma exchange also replaces the ADAMTS13 enzyme.
                
If plasma exchange isn't available, you may be given fresh frozen plasma until it is available.
                
During plasma exchange, an IV needle or tube is placed in a vein in your arm to remove blood. The blood goes through a cell separator, which removes plasma from the blood. The nonplasma part of the blood is saved, and donated plasma is added to it.
                
Then, the blood is put back into you through an IV line inserted into one of your blood vessels. The time required to complete the procedure varies, but it often takes about 2hours.
                
Treatments of fresh frozen plasma or plasma exchange usually continue until your blood tests results and signs and symptoms improve. This can take days or weeks, depending on your condition. You'll stay in the hospital while you recover.
                
Some people who recover from TTP have flareups. This can happen in the hospital or after you go home. If you have a flareup, your doctor will restart plasma therapy.
                
Other Treatments
                
Other treatments are used if plasma therapy doesn't work well or if flareups occur often.
                
For acquired TTP, medicines can slow or stop antibodies to the ADAMTS13 enzyme from forming. Medicines used to treat TTP include glucocorticoids, vincristine, rituximab, and cyclosporine A.
                
Sometimes surgery to remove the spleen (an organ in the abdomen) is needed. This is because cells in the spleen make the antibodies that block ADAMTS13 enzyme activity.",treatment,Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura,What are the treatments for Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura ?,Drugs

NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/asthma,"Asthma is a long-term disease that has no cure. The goal of asthma treatment is to control the disease. Good asthma control will:
                
Prevent chronic and troublesome symptoms, such as coughing and shortness of breath
                
Reduce your need for quick-relief medicines (see below)
                
Help you maintain good lung function
                
Let you maintain your normal activity level and sleep through the night
                
Prevent asthma attacks that could result in an emergency room visit or hospital stay
                
To control asthma, partner with your doctor to manage your asthma or your child's asthma. Children aged 10 or olderand younger children who are ableshould take an active role in their asthma care.
                
Taking an active role to control your asthma involves:
                
Working with your doctor to treat other conditions that can interfere with asthma management.
                
Avoiding things that worsen your asthma (asthma triggers). However, one trigger you should not avoid is physical activity. Physical activity is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. Talk with your doctor about medicines that can help you stay active.
                
Working with your doctor and other health care providers to create and follow an asthma action plan.
                
An asthma action plan gives guidance on taking your medicines properly, avoiding asthma triggers (except physical activity), tracking your level of asthma control, responding to worsening symptoms, and seeking emergency care when needed.
                
Asthma is treated with two types of medicines: long-term control and quick-relief medicines. Long-term control medicines help reduce airway inflammation and prevent asthma symptoms. Quick-relief, or ""rescue,"" medicines relieve asthma symptoms that may flare up.
                
Your initial treatment will depend on the severity of your asthma. Followup asthma treatment will depend on how well your asthma action plan is controlling your symptoms and preventing asthma attacks.
                
Your level of asthma control can vary over time and with changes in your home, school, or work environments. These changes can alter how often you're exposed to the factors that can worsen your asthma.
                
Your doctor may need to increase your medicine if your asthma doesn't stay under control. On the other hand, if your asthma is well controlled for several months, your doctor may decrease your medicine. These adjustments to your medicine will help you maintain the best control possible with the least amount of medicine necessary.
                
Asthma treatment for certain groups of peoplesuch as children, pregnant women, or those for whom exercise brings on asthma symptomswill be adjusted to meet their special needs.
                
Follow an Asthma Action Plan
                
You can work with your doctor to create a personal asthma action plan. The plan will describe your daily treatments, such as which medicines to take and when to take them. The plan also will explain when to call your doctor or go to the emergency room.
                
If your child has asthma, all of the people who care for him or her should know about the child's asthma action plan. This includes babysitters and workers at daycare centers, schools, and camps. These caretakers can help your child follow his or her action plan.
                
Go to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's (NHLBI's) ""Asthma Action Plan"" for a sample plan.
                
Avoid Things That Can Worsen Your Asthma
                
Many common things (called asthma triggers) can set off or worsen your asthma symptoms. Once you know what these things are, you can take steps to control many of them. (For more information about asthma triggers, go to ""What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Asthma?"")
                
For example, exposure to pollens or air pollution might make your asthma worse. If so, try to limit time outdoors when the levels of these substances in the outdoor air are high. If animal fur triggers your asthma symptoms, keep pets with fur out of your home or bedroom.
                
One possible asthma trigger you shouldnt avoid is physical activity. Physical activity is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. Talk with your doctor about medicines that can help you stay active.
                
The NHLBI offers many useful tips for controlling asthma triggers. For more information, go to page 2 of NHLBI's ""Asthma Action Plan.""
                
If your asthma symptoms are clearly related to allergens, and you can't avoid exposure to those allergens, your doctor may advise you to get allergy shots.
                
You may need to see a specialist if you're thinking about getting allergy shots. These shots can lessen or prevent your asthma symptoms, but they can't cure your asthma.
                
Several health conditions can make asthma harder to manage. These conditions include runny nose, sinus infections, reflux disease, psychological stress, and sleep apnea. Your doctor will treat these conditions as well.
                
Medicines
                
Your doctor will consider many things when deciding which asthma medicines are best for you. He or she will check to see how well a medicine works for you. Then, he or she will adjust the dose or medicine as needed.
                
Asthma medicines can be taken in pill form, but most are taken using a device called an inhaler. An inhaler allows the medicine to go directly to your lungs.
                
Not all inhalers are used the same way. Ask your doctor or another health care provider to show you the right way to use your inhaler. Review the way you use your inhaler at every medical visit.
                
Long-Term Control Medicines
                
Most people who have asthma need to take long-term control medicines daily to help prevent symptoms. The most effective long-term medicines reduce airway inflammation, which helps prevent symptoms from starting. These medicines don't give you quick relief from symptoms.
                
Inhaled corticosteroids. Inhaled corticosteroids are the preferred medicine for long-term control of asthma. They're the most effective option for long-term relief of the inflammation and swelling that makes your airways sensitive to certain inhaled substances.
                
Reducing inflammation helps prevent the chain reaction that causes asthma symptoms. Most people who take these medicines daily find they greatly reduce the severity of symptoms and how often they occur.
                
Inhaled corticosteroids generally are safe when taken as prescribed. These medicines are different from the illegal anabolic steroids taken by some athletes. Inhaled corticosteroids aren't habit-forming, even if you take them every day for many years.
                
Like many other medicines, though, inhaled corticosteroids can have side effects. Most doctors agree that the benefits of taking inhaled corticosteroids and preventing asthma attacks far outweigh the risk of side effects.
                
One common side effect from inhaled corticosteroids is a mouth infection called thrush. You might be able to use a spacer or holding chamber on your inhaler to avoid thrush. These devices attach to your inhaler. They help prevent the medicine from landing in your mouth or on the back of your throat.
                
Check with your doctor to see whether a spacer or holding chamber should be used with the inhaler you have. Also, work with your health care team if you have any questions about how to use a spacer or holding chamber. Rinsing your mouth out with water after taking inhaled corticosteroids also can lower your risk for thrush.
                
If you have severe asthma, you may have to take corticosteroid pills or liquid for short periods to get your asthma under control.
                
If taken for long periods, these medicines raise your risk for cataracts and osteoporosis (OS-te-o-po-RO-sis). A cataract is the clouding of the lens in your eye. Osteoporosis is a disorder that makes your bones weak and more likely to break.
                
Your doctor may have you add another long-term asthma control medicine so he or she can lower your dose of corticosteroids. Or, your doctor may suggest you take calcium and vitamin D pills to protect your bones.
                
Other long-term control medicines. Other long-term control medicines include:
                
Cromolyn. This medicine is taken using a device called a nebulizer. As you breathe in, the nebulizer sends a fine mist of medicine to your lungs. Cromolyn helps prevent airway inflammation.
                
Omalizumab (anti-IgE). This medicine is given as a shot (injection) one or two times a month. It helps prevent your body from reacting to asthma triggers, such as pollen and dust mites. Anti-IgE might be used if other asthma medicines have not worked well.
                
A rare, but possibly life-threatening allergic reaction called anaphylaxis might occur when the Omalizumab injection is given. If you take this medication, work with your doctor to make sure you understand the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis and what actions you should take.
                
Inhaled long-acting beta2-agonists. These medicines open the airways. They might be added to inhaled corticosteroids to improve asthma control. Inhaled long-acting beta2-agonists should never be used on their own for long-term asthma control. They must used with inhaled corticosteroids.
                
Leukotriene modifiers. These medicines are taken by mouth. They help block the chain reaction that increases inflammation in your airways.
                
Theophylline. This medicine is taken by mouth. Theophylline helps open the airways.
                
If your doctor prescribes a long-term control medicine, take it every day to control your asthma. Your asthma symptoms will likely return or get worse if you stop taking your medicine.
                
Long-term control medicines can have side effects. Talk with your doctor about these side effects and ways to reduce or avoid them.
                
With some medicines, like theophylline, your doctor will check the level of medicine in your blood. This helps ensure that youre getting enough medicine to relieve your asthma symptoms, but not so much that it causes dangerous side effects.
                
Quick-Relief Medicines
                
All people who have asthma need quick-relief medicines to help relieve asthma symptoms that may flare up. Inhaled short-acting beta2-agonists are the first choice for quick relief.
                
These medicines act quickly to relax tight muscles around your airways when you're having a flareup. This allows the airways to open up so air can flow through them.
                
You should take your quick-relief medicine when you first notice asthma symptoms. If you use this medicine more than 2 days a week, talk with your doctor about your asthma control. You may need to make changes to your asthma action plan.
                
Carry your quick-relief inhaler with you at all times in case you need it. If your child has asthma, make sure that anyone caring for him or her has the child's quick-relief medicines, including staff at the child's school. They should understand when and how to use these medicines and when to seek medical care for your child.
                
You shouldn't use quick-relief medicines in place of prescribed long-term control medicines. Quick-relief medicines don't reduce inflammation.
                
Track Your Asthma
                
To track your asthma, keep records of your symptoms, check your peak flow number using a peak flow meter, and get regular asthma checkups.
                
Record Your Symptoms
                
You can record your asthma symptoms in a diary to see how well your treatments are controlling your asthma.
                
Asthma is well controlled if:
                
You have symptoms no more than 2 days a week, and these symptoms don't wake you from sleep more than 1 or 2 nights a month.
                
You can do all your normal activities.
                
You take quick-relief medicines no more than 2 days a week.
                
You have no more than one asthma attack a year that requires you to take corticosteroids by mouth.
                
Your peak flow doesn't drop below 80 percent of your personal best number.
                
If your asthma isn't well controlled, contact your doctor. He or she may need to change your asthma action plan.
                
Use a Peak Flow Meter
                
This small, hand-held device shows how well air moves out of your lungs. You blow into the device and it gives you a score, or peak flow number. Your score shows how well your lungs are working at the time of the test.
                
Your doctor will tell you how and when to use your peak flow meter. He or she also will teach you how to take your medicines based on your score.
                
Your doctor and other health care providers may ask you to use your peak flow meter each morning and keep a record of your results. You may find it very useful to record peak flow scores for a couple of weeks before each medical visit and take the results with you.
                
When you're first diagnosed with asthma, it's important to find your ""personal best"" peak flow number. To do this, you record your score each day for a 2- to 3-week period when your asthma is well-controlled. The highest number you get during that time is your personal best. You can compare this number to future numbers to make sure your asthma is controlled.
                
Your peak flow meter can help warn you of an asthma attack, even before you notice symptoms. If your score shows that your breathing is getting worse, you should take your quick-relief medicines the way your asthma action plan directs. Then you can use the peak flow meter to check how well the medicine worked.
                
Get Asthma Checkups
                
When you first begin treatment, you'll see your doctor about every 2 to 6 weeks. Once your asthma is controlled, your doctor may want to see you from once a month to twice a year.
                
During these checkups, your doctor may ask whether you've had an asthma attack since the last visit or any changes in symptoms or peak flow measurements. He or she also may ask about your daily activities. This information will help your doctor assess your level of asthma control.
                
Your doctor also may ask whether you have any problems or concerns with taking your medicines or following your asthma action plan. Based on your answers to these questions, your doctor may change the dose of your medicine or give you a new medicine.
                
If your control is very good, you might be able to take less medicine. The goal is to use the least amount of medicine needed to control your asthma.
                
Emergency Care
                
Most people who have asthma, including many children, can safely manage their symptoms by following their asthma action plans. However, you might need medical attention at times.
                
Call your doctor for advice if:
                
Your medicines don't relieve an asthma attack.
                
Your peak flow is less than half of your personal best peak flow number.
                
Call 911 for emergency care if:
                
You have trouble walking and talking because you're out of breath.
                
You have blue lips or fingernails.
                
At the hospital, you'll be closely watched and given oxygen and more medicines, as well as medicines at higher doses than you take at home. Such treatment can save your life.
                
Asthma Treatment for Special Groups
                
The treatments described above generally apply to all people who have asthma. However, some aspects of treatment differ for people in certain age groups and those who have special needs.
                
Children
                
It's hard to diagnose asthma in children younger than 5 years. Thus, it's hard to know whether young children who wheeze or have other asthma symptoms will benefit from long-term control medicines. (Quick-relief medicines tend to relieve wheezing in young children whether they have asthma or not.)
                
Doctors will treat infants and young children who have asthma symptoms with long-term control medicines if, after assessing a child, they feel that the symptoms are persistent and likely to continue after 6 years of age. (For more information, go to ""How Is Asthma Diagnosed?"")
                
Inhaled corticosteroids are the preferred treatment for young children. Montelukast and cromolyn are other options. Treatment might be given for a trial period of 1month to 6 weeks. Treatment usually is stopped if benefits aren't seen during that time and the doctor and parents are confident the medicine was used properly.
                
Inhaled corticosteroids can possibly slow the growth of children of all ages. Slowed growth usually is apparent in the first several months of treatment, is generally small, and doesn't get worse over time. Poorly controlled asthma also may reduce a child's growth rate.
                
Many experts think the benefits of inhaled corticosteroids for children who need them to control their asthma far outweigh the risk of slowed growth.
                
Older Adults
                
Doctors may need to adjust asthma treatment for older adults who take certain other medicines, such as beta blockers, aspirin and other pain relievers, and anti-inflammatory medicines. These medicines can prevent asthma medicines from working well and may worsen asthma symptoms.
                
Be sure to tell your doctor about all of the medicines you take, including over-the-counter medicines.
                
Older adults may develop weak bones from using inhaled corticosteroids, especially at high doses. Talk with your doctor about taking calcium and vitamin D pills, as well as other ways to help keep your bones strong.
                
Pregnant Women
                
Pregnant women who have asthma need to control the disease to ensure a good supply of oxygen to their babies. Poor asthma control increases the risk of preeclampsia, a condition in which a pregnant woman develops high blood pressure and protein in the urine. Poor asthma control also increases the risk that a baby will be born early and have a low birth weight.
                
Studies show that it's safer to take asthma medicines while pregnant than to risk having an asthma attack.
                
Talk with your doctor if you have asthma and are pregnant or planning a pregnancy. Your level of asthma control may get better or it may get worse while you're pregnant. Your health care team will check your asthma control often and adjust your treatment as needed.
                
People Whose Asthma Symptoms Occur With Physical Activity
                
Physical activity is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. Adults need physical activity to maintain good health. Children need it for growth and development.
                
In some people, however, physical activity can trigger asthma symptoms. If this happens to you or your child, talk with your doctor about the best ways to control asthma so you can stay active.
                
The following medicines may help prevent asthma symptoms caused by physical activity:
                
Short-acting beta2-agonists (quick-relief medicine) taken shortly before physical activity can last 2 to 3 hours and prevent exercise-related symptoms in most people who take them.
                
Long-acting beta2-agonists can be protective for up to 12 hours. However, with daily use, they'll no longer give up to 12 hours of protection. Also, frequent use of these medicines for physical activity might be a sign that asthma is poorly controlled.
                
Leukotriene modifiers. These pills are taken several hours before physical activity. They can help relieve asthma symptoms brought on by physical activity.
                
Long-term control medicines. Frequent or severe symptoms due to physical activity may suggest poorly controlled asthma and the need to either start or increase long-term control medicines that reduce inflammation. This will help prevent exercise-related symptoms.
                
Easing into physical activity with a warmup period may be helpful. You also may want to wear a mask or scarf over your mouth when exercising in cold weather.
                
If you use your asthma medicines as your doctor directs, you should be able to take part in any physical activity or sport you choose.
                
People Having Surgery
                
Asthma may add to the risk of having problems during and after surgery. For instance, having a tube put into your throat may cause an asthma attack.
                
Tell your surgeon about your asthma when you first talk with him or her. The surgeon can take steps to lower your risk, such as giving you asthma medicines before or during surgery.",treatment,Asthma,What are the treatments for Asthma ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/asthma,"You cant prevent asthma. However, you can take steps to control the disease and prevent its symptoms. For example:
                
Learn about your asthma and ways to control it.
                
Follow your written asthma action plan. (For a sample plan, go to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's ""Asthma Action Plan."")
                
Use medicines as your doctor prescribes.
                
Identify and try to avoid things that make your asthma worse (asthma triggers). However, one trigger you should not avoid is physical activity. Physical activity is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. Talk with your doctor about medicines that can help you stay active.
                
Keep track of your asthma symptoms and level of control.
                
Get regular checkups for your asthma.

NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/itp,"Treatment for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is based on how much and how often you're bleeding and your platelet count.
                
Adults who have mild ITP may not need any treatment, other than watching their symptoms and platelet counts. Adults who have ITP with very low platelet counts or bleeding problems often are treated.
                
The acute (short-term) type of ITP that occurs in children often goes away within a few weeks or months. Children who have bleeding symptoms, other than merely bruising (purpura), usually are treated.
                
Children who have mild ITP may not need treatment other than monitoring and followup to make sure their platelet counts return to normal.
                
Medicines
                
Medicines often are used as the first course of treatment for both children and adults.
                
Corticosteroids (cor-ti-co-STEER-roids), such as prednisone, are commonly used to treat ITP. These medicines, called steroids for short, help increase your platelet count. However, steroids have many side effects. Some people relapse (get worse) when treatment ends.
                
The steroids used to treat ITP are different from the illegal steroids that some athletes take to enhance performance. Corticosteroids aren't habit-forming, even if you take them for many years.
                
Other medicines also are used to raise the platelet count. Some are given through a needle inserted into a vein. These medicines include rituximab, immune globulin, and anti-Rh (D) immunoglobulin.
                
Medicines also may be used with a procedure to remove the spleen called splenectomy (splee-NECK-tuh-mee).
                
If medicines or splenectomy don't help, two newer medicineseltrombopag and romiplostimcan be used to treat ITP.
                
Removal of the Spleen (Splenectomy)
                
If needed, doctors can surgically remove the spleen. This organ is located in the upper left abdomen. The spleen is about the size of a golf ball in children and a baseball in adults.
                
The spleen makes antibodies (proteins) that help fight infections. In ITP, these antibodies destroy platelets by mistake.
                
If ITP hasn't responded to medicines, removing the spleen will reduce the destruction of platelets. However, it also may raise your risk for infections. Before you have the surgery, your doctor may give you vaccines to help prevent infections.
                
If your spleen is removed, your doctor will explain what steps you can take to help avoid infections and what symptoms to watch for.
                
Other Treatments
                
Platelet Transfusions
                
Some people who have ITP with severe bleeding may need to have platelet transfusions and be hospitalized. Some people will need platelet transfusions before having surgery.
                
For a platelet transfusion, donor platelets from a blood bank are injected into the recipient's bloodstream. This increases the platelet count for a short time.
                
For more information about platelet transfusions, go to the Health Topics Blood Transfusion article.
                
Treating Infections
                
Some infections can briefly lower your platelet count. Treating the infection may help increase your platelet count and reduce bleeding problems.
                
Stopping Medicines
                
Some medicines can lower your platelet count or cause bleeding. Stopping the medicine can sometimes help raise your platelet count or prevent bleeding.
                
For example, aspirin and ibuprofen are common medicines that increase the risk of bleeding. If you have ITP, your doctor may suggest that you avoid these medicines.",treatment,Immune Thrombocytopenia,What are the treatments for Immune Thrombocytopenia ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/itp,"You can't prevent immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), but you can prevent its complications.
                
Talk with your doctor about which medicines are safe for you. Your doctor may advise you to avoid medicines that can affect your platelets and increase your risk of bleeding. Examples of such medicines include aspirin and ibuprofen.
                
Protect yourself from injuries that can cause bruising or bleeding.
                
Seek treatment right away if you develop any infections. Report any symptoms of infection, such as a fever, to your doctor. This is very important for people who have ITP and have had their spleens removed.",prevention,Immune Thrombocytopenia,How to prevent Immune Thrombocytopenia ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/stroke,"Treatment for a stroke depends on whether it is ischemic or hemorrhagic. Treatment for a transient ischemic attack (TIA) depends on its cause, how much time has passed since symptoms began, and whether you have other medical conditions.
                
Strokes and TIAs are medical emergencies. If you have stroke symptoms, call 911 right away. Do not drive to the hospital or let someone else drive you. Call an ambulance so that medical personnel can begin lifesaving treatment on the way to the emergency room. During a stroke, every minute counts.
                
Once you receive immediate treatment, your doctor will try to treat your stroke risk factors and prevent complications by recommending heart-healthy lifestyle changes.
                
Treating an Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack
                
An ischemic stroke or TIA occurs if an artery that supplies oxygen-rich blood to the brain becomes blocked. Often, blood clots cause the blockages that lead to ischemic strokes and TIAs. Treatment for an ischemic stroke or TIA may include medicines and medical procedures.
                
Medicines
                
If you have a stroke caused by a blood clot, you may be given a clot-dissolving, or clot-busting, medication called tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). A doctor will inject tPA into a vein in your arm. This type of medication must be given within 4hours of symptom onset. Ideally, it should be given as soon as possible. The sooner treatment begins, the better your chances of recovery. Thus, its important to know the signs and symptoms of a stroke and to call 911 right away for emergency care.
                
If you cant have tPA for medical reasons, your doctor may give you antiplatelet medicine that helps stop platelets from clumping together to form blood clots or anticoagulant medicine (blood thinner) that keeps existing blood clots from getting larger. Two common medicines are aspirin and clopidogrel.
                
Medical Procedures
                
If you have carotid artery disease, your doctor may recommend a carotid endarterectomy or carotid arteryangioplasty. Both procedures open blocked carotid arteries.
                
Researchers are testing other treatments for ischemic stroke, such as intra-arterial thrombolysis and mechanical clot removal in cerebral ischemia (MERCI).
                
In intra-arterial thrombolysis, a long flexible tube called a catheter is put into your groin (upper thigh) and threaded to the tiny arteries of the brain. Your doctor can deliver medicine through this catheter to break up a blood clot in the brain.
                
MERCI is a device that can remove blood clots from an artery. During the procedure, a catheter is threaded through a carotid artery to the affected artery in the brain. The device is then used to pull the blood clot out through the catheter.
                
Treating a Hemorrhagic Stroke
                
A hemorrhagic stroke occurs if an artery in the brain leaks blood or ruptures. The first steps in treating a hemorrhagic stroke are to find the cause of bleeding in the brain and then control it. Unlike ischemic strokes, hemorrhagic strokes arent treated with antiplatelet medicines and blood thinners because these medicines can make bleeding worse.
                
If youre taking antiplatelet medicines or blood thinners and have a hemorrhagic stroke, youll be taken off the medicine. If high blood pressure is the cause of bleeding in the brain, your doctor may prescribe medicines to lower your blood pressure. This can help prevent further bleeding.
                
Surgery also may be needed to treat a hemorrhagic stroke. The types of surgery used include aneurysm clipping, coil embolization, and arteriovenous malformation (AVM) repair.
                
Aneurysm Clipping and Coil Embolization
                
If an aneurysm (a balloon-like bulge in an artery) is the cause of a stroke, your doctor may recommend aneurysm clipping or coil embolization.
                
Aneurysm clipping is done to block off the aneurysm from the blood vessels in the brain. This surgery helps prevent further leaking of blood from the aneurysm. It also can help prevent the aneurysm from bursting again.During the procedure, a surgeon will make an incision (cut) in the brain and place a tiny clamp at the base of the aneurysm. Youll be given medicine to make you sleep during the surgery. After the surgery, youll need to stay in the hospitals intensive care unit for a few days.
                
Coil embolization is a less complex procedure for treating an aneurysm. The surgeon will insert a tube called a catheter into an artery in the groin. He or she will thread the tube to the site of the aneurysm.Then, a tiny coil will be pushed through the tube and into the aneurysm. The coil will cause a blood clot to form, which will block blood flow through the aneurysm and prevent it from burstingagain.Coil embolization is done in a hospital. Youll be given medicine to make you sleep during thesurgery.
                
Arteriovenous Malformation Repair
                
If an AVM is the cause of a stroke, your doctor may recommend an AVM repair. (An AVM is a tangle of faulty arteries and veins that can rupture within the brain.) AVM repair helps prevent further bleeding in the brain.
                
Doctors use several methods to repair AVMs. These methods include:
                
Injecting a substance into the blood vessels of the AVM to block blood flow
                
Surgery to remove the AVM
                
Using radiation to shrink the blood vessels of the AVM
                
Treating Stroke Risk Factors
                
After initial treatment for a stroke or TIA, your doctor will treat your risk factors. He or she may recommend heart-healthy lifestyle changes to help control your risk factors.
                
Heart-healthy lifestyle changes may include:
                
heart-healthy eating
                
maintaining a healthy weight
                
managing stress
                
physical activity
                
quitting smoking
                
If lifestyle changes arent enough, you may need medicine to control your risk factors.
                
Heart-Healthy Eating
                
Your doctor may recommend heart-healthy eating, which should include:
                
Fat-free or low-fat dairy products, such as skim milk
                
Fish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and trout, about twice a week
                
Fruits, such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes
                
Legumes, such as kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans
                
Vegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and carrots
                
Whole grains, such as oatmeal, brown rice, and corn tortillas
                
When following a heart-healthy diet, you should avoid eating:
                
A lot of red meat
                
Palm and coconut oils
                
Sugary foods and beverages
                
Two nutrients in your diet make blood cholesterol levels rise:
                
Saturated fatfound mostly in foods that come from animals
                
Trans fat (trans fatty acids)found in foods made with hydrogenated oils and fats, such as stick margarine; baked goods, such as cookies, cakes, and pies; crackers; frostings; and coffee creamers. Some trans fats also occur naturally in animal fats and meats.
                
Saturated fat raises your blood cholesterol more than anything else in your diet. When you follow a heart-healthy eating plan, only 5percent to 6percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. Food labels list the amounts of saturated fat. To help you stay on track, here are some examples:
                
1,200 calories a day
                
8 grams of saturated fat a day
                
1,500 calories a day
                
10 grams of saturated fat a day
                
1,800 calories a day
                
12 grams of saturated fat a day
                
2,000 calories a day
                
13 grams of saturated fat a day
                
2,500 calories a day
                
17 grams of saturated fat a day
                
Not all fats are bad. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats actually help lower blood cholesterol levels. Some sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are:
                
Avocados
                
Corn, sunflower, and soybean oils
                
Nuts and seeds, such as walnuts
                
Olive, canola, peanut, safflower, and sesame oils
                
Peanut butter
                
Salmon and trout
                
Tofu
                
Sodium
                
Try to limit the amount of sodium that you eat. This means choosing and preparing foods that are lower in salt and sodium. Try to use low-sodium and no added salt foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. Food labels tell you what you need to know about choosing foods that are lower in sodium. Try to eat no more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium a day. If you have high blood pressure, you may need to restrict your sodium intake even more.
                
Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension
                
Your doctor may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan if you have high blood pressure. The DASH eating plan focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and low in fat, cholesterol, and sodium and salt.
                
The DASH eating plan is a good heart-healthy eating plan, even for those who dont have high blood pressure. Read more about DASH.
                
Alcohol
                
Try to limit alcohol intake. Too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure and triglyceride levels, a type of fat found in the blood. Alcohol also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain.
                
Men should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day. Women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day. One drink is:
                
12 ounces of beer
                
5 ounces of wine
                
1 ounces of liquor
                
Maintaining a Healthy Weight
                
Maintaining a healthy weight is important for overall health and can lower your risk for stroke. Aim for a Healthy Weight by following a heart-healthy eating plan and keeping physically active.
                
Knowing your body mass index (BMI) helps you find out if youre a healthy weight in relation to your height and gives an estimate of your total body fat. To figure out your BMI, check out the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes (NHLBI) online BMI calculator or talk to your doctor. A BMI:
                
Below 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight.
                
Between 18.5 and 24.9 is in the normal range.
                
Between 25.0 and 29.9 is considered overweight.
                
Of 30.0 or higher is considered obese.
                
A general goal to aim for is a BMI of less than 25. Your doctor or health care provider can help you set an appropriate BMI goal.
                
Measuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. If most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type2 diabetes. This risk may be high with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. To learn how to measure your waist, visit Assessing Your Weight and Health Risk.
                
If youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. A loss of just 3 percent to 5 percent of your current weight can lower your triglycerides, blood glucose, and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Greater amounts of weight loss can improve blood pressure readings, lower LDL cholesterol, and increase HDL cholesterol.
                
Managing Stress
                
Learning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health. Consider healthy stress-reducing activities, such as:
                
A stress management program
                
Meditation
                
Physical activity
                
Relaxation therapy
                
Talking things out with friends or family
                
Physical Activity
                
Regular physical activity can lower many risk factors for stroke.
                
Everyone should try to participate in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2hours and 30minutes per week or vigorous aerobic exercise for 1hour and 15minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats faster and you use more oxygen than usual. The more active you are, the more you will benefit. Participate in aerobic exercise for at least 10minutes at a time spread throughout the week.
                
Talk with your doctor before you start a new exercise plan. Ask your doctor how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you.

Quitting Smoking
                
If you smoke or use tobacco, quit. Smoking can damage and tighten blood vessels and raise your risk for stroke. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke. If you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking.

NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/anemia,"Treatment for anemia depends on the type, cause, and severity of the condition. Treatments may include dietary changes or supplements, medicines, procedures, or surgery to treat blood loss.
                
Goals of Treatment
                
The goal of treatment is to increase the amount of oxygen that your blood can carry. This is done by raising the red blood cell count and/or hemoglobin level. (Hemoglobin is the iron-rich protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to the body.)
                
Another goal is to treat the underlying cause of the anemia.
                
Dietary Changes and Supplements
                
Low levels of vitamins or iron in the body can cause some types of anemia. These low levels might be the result of a poor diet or certain diseases or conditions.
                
To raise your vitamin or iron level, your doctor may ask you to change your diet or take vitamin or iron supplements. Common vitamin supplements are vitamin B12 and folic acid (folate). Vitamin C sometimes is given to help the body absorb iron.
                
Iron
                
Your body needs iron to make hemoglobin. Your body can more easily absorb iron from meats than from vegetables or other foods. To treat your anemia, your doctor may suggest eating more meatespecially red meat (such as beef or liver), as well as chicken, turkey, pork, fish, and shellfish.
                
Nonmeat foods that are good sources of iron include:
                
Spinach and other dark green leafy vegetables
                
Tofu
                
Peas; lentils; white, red, and baked beans; soybeans; and chickpeas
                
Dried fruits, such as prunes, raisins, and apricots
                
Prune juice
                
Iron-fortified cereals and breads
                
You can look at the Nutrition Facts label on packaged foods to find out how much iron the items contain. The amount is given as a percentage of the total amount of iron you need every day.
                
Iron also is available as a supplement. It's usually combined with multivitamins and other minerals that help your body absorb iron.
                
Doctors may recommend iron supplements for premature infants, infants and young children who drink a lot of cow's milk, and infants who are fed breast milk only or formula that isn't fortified with iron.
                
Large amounts of iron can be harmful, so take iron supplements only as your doctor prescribes.
                
Vitamin B12
                
Low levels of vitamin B12 can lead to pernicious anemia. This type of anemia often is treated with vitamin B12 supplements.
                
Good food sources of vitamin B12 include:
                
Breakfast cereals with added vitamin B12
                
Meats such as beef, liver, poultry, and fish
                
Eggs and dairy products (such as milk, yogurt, and cheese)
                
Foods fortified with vitamin B12, such as soy-based beverages and vegetarian burgers
                
Folic Acid
                
Folic acid (folate) is a form of vitamin B that's found in foods. Your body needs folic acid to make and maintain new cells. Folic acid also is very important for pregnant women. It helps them avoid anemia and promotes healthy growth of the fetus.
                
Good sources of folic acid include:
                
Bread, pasta, and rice with added folic acid
                
Spinach and other dark green leafy vegetables
                
Black-eyed peas and dried beans
                
Beef liver
                
Eggs
                
Bananas, oranges, orange juice, and some other fruits and juices
                
Vitamin C
                
Vitamin C helps the body absorb iron. Good sources of vitamin C are vegetables and fruits, especially citrus fruits. Citrus fruits include oranges, grapefruits, tangerines, and similar fruits. Fresh and frozen fruits, vegetables, and juices usually have more vitaminC than canned ones.
                
If you're taking medicines, ask your doctor or pharmacist whether you can eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice. This fruit can affect the strength of a few medicines and how well they work.
                
Other fruits rich in vitamin C include kiwi fruit, strawberries, and cantaloupes.
                
Vegetables rich in vitamin C include broccoli, peppers, Brussels sprouts, tomatoes, cabbage, potatoes, and leafy green vegetables like turnip greens and spinach.
                
Medicines
                
Your doctor may prescribe medicines to help your body make more red blood cells or to treat an underlying cause of anemia. Some of these medicines include:
                
Antibiotics to treat infections.
                
Hormones to treat heavy menstrual bleeding in teenaged and adult women.
                
A man-made version of erythropoietin to stimulate your body to make more red blood cells. This hormone has some risks. You and your doctor will decide whether the benefits of this treatment outweigh the risks.
                
Medicines to prevent the body's immune system from destroying its own red blood cells.
                
Chelation (ke-LAY-shun) therapy for lead poisoning. Chelation therapy is used mainly in children. This is because children who have iron-deficiency anemia are at increased risk of lead poisoning.
                
Procedures
                
If your anemia is severe, your doctor may recommend a medical procedure. Procedures include blood transfusions and blood and marrow stem cell transplants.
                
Blood Transfusion
                
A blood transfusion is a safe, common procedure in which blood is given to you through an intravenous (IV) line in one of your blood vessels. Transfusions require careful matching of donated blood with the recipient's blood.
                
For more information, go to the Health Topics Blood Transfusion article.
                
Blood and Marrow Stem Cell Transplant
                
A blood and marrow stem cell transplant replaces your faulty stem cells with healthy ones from another person (a donor). Stem cells are made in the bone marrow. They develop into red and white blood cells and platelets.
                
During the transplant, which is like a blood transfusion, you get donated stem cells through a tube placed in a vein in your chest. Once the stem cells are in your body, they travel to your bone marrow and begin making new blood cells.
                
For more information, go to the Health Topics Blood and Marrow Stem Cell Transplant article.
                
Surgery
                
If you have serious or life-threatening bleeding that's causing anemia, you may need surgery. For example, you may need surgery to control ongoing bleeding due to a stomach ulcer or colon cancer.
                
If your body is destroying red blood cells at a high rate, you may need to have your spleen removed. The spleen is an organ that removes wornout red blood cells from the body. An enlarged or diseased spleen may remove more red blood cells than normal, causing anemia.",treatment,Anemia,What are the treatments for Anemia ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/anemia,"You might be able to prevent repeat episodes of some types of anemia, especially those caused by lack of iron or vitamins. Dietary changes or supplements can prevent these types of anemia from occurring again.
                
Treating anemia's underlying cause may prevent the condition (or prevent repeat episodes). For example, if medicine is causing your anemia, your doctor may prescribe another type of medicine.
                
To prevent anemia from getting worse, tell your doctor about all of your signs and symptoms. Talk with your doctor about the tests you may need and follow your treatment plan.

NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/hemo,"Treatments for hemochromatosis include therapeutic phlebotomy (fleh-BOT-o-me), iron chelation (ke-LAY-shun) therapy, dietary changes, and treatment for complications.
                
The goals of treating hemochromatosis include:
                
Reducing the amount of iron in your body to normal levels
                
Preventing or delaying organ damage from iron overload
                
Treating complications of the disease
                
Maintaining a normal amount of iron in your body for the rest of your life
                
Therapeutic Phlebotomy
                
Therapeutic phlebotomy is a procedure that removes blood (and iron) from your body. A needle is inserted into a vein, and your blood flows through an airtight tube into a sterile container or bag.
                
The process is similar to donating blood; it can be done at blood donation centers, hospital donation centers, or a doctor's office.
                
In the first stage of treatment, about 1 pint of blood is removed once or twice a week. After your iron levels return to normal, you may continue phlebotomy treatments. However, you may need them less oftentypically every 24 months.
                
As long as treatment continues, which often is for the rest of your life, you'll need frequent blood tests to check your iron levels.
                
Iron Chelation Therapy
                
Iron chelation therapy uses medicine to remove excess iron from your body. This treatment is a good option for people who can't have routine blood removal.
                
The medicine used in iron chelation therapy is either injected or taken orally (by mouth). Injected iron chelation therapy is done at a doctor's office. Oral iron chelation therapy can be done at home.
                
Dietary Changes
                
Your doctor may suggest that you change your diet if you have hemochromatosis. You may be advised to:
                
Avoid taking iron, including iron pills, iron injections, or multivitamins that contain iron.
                
Limit your intake of vitamin C. Vitamin C helps your body absorb iron from food. Talk with your doctor about how much vitamin C is safe for you.
                
Avoid uncooked fish and shellfish. Some fish and shellfish contain bacteria that can cause infections in people who have chronic diseases, such as hemochromatosis.
                
Limit alcohol intake. Drinking alcohol increases the risk of liver disease. It also can make existing liver disease worse.
                
Treatment for Complications
                
Your doctor may prescribe other treatments as needed for complications such as liver disease, heart problems, or diabetes.",treatment,Hemochromatosis,What are the treatments for Hemochromatosis ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/hemo,"You can't prevent primary, or inherited, hemochromatosis.

NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/af,"Treatment for atrial fibrillation (AF) depends on how often you have symptoms, how severe they are, and whether you already have heart disease. General treatment options include medicines, medical procedures, and lifestyle changes.
                
Goals of Treatment
                
The goals of treating AF include:
                
Preventing blood clots from forming, thus lowering the risk of stroke.
                
Controlling how many times a minute the ventricles contract. This is called rate control. Rate control is important because it allows the ventricles enough time to completely fill with blood. With this approach, the abnormal heart rhythm continues, but you feel better and have fewer symptoms.
                
Restoring a normal heart rhythm. This is called rhythm control. Rhythm control allows the atria and ventricles to work together to efficiently pump blood to the body.
                
Treating any underlying disorder that's causing or raising the risk of AFfor example, hyperthyroidism (too much thyroid hormone).
                
Who Needs Treatment for Atrial Fibrillation?
                
People who have AF but don't have symptoms or related heart problems may not need treatment. AF may even go back to a normal heart rhythm on its own. (This also can occur in people who have AF with symptoms.)
                
In some people who have AF for the first time, doctors may choose to use an electrical procedure or medicine to restore a normal heart rhythm.
                
Repeat episodes of AF tend to cause changes to the heart's electrical system, leading to persistent or permanent AF. Most people who have persistent or permanent AF need treatment to control their heart rate and prevent complications.
                
Specific Types of Treatment
                
Blood Clot Prevention
                
People who have AF are at increased risk for stroke. This is because blood can pool in the heart's upper chambers (the atria), causing a blood clot to form. If the clot breaks off and travels to the brain, it can cause a stroke.
                
Preventing blood clots from forming is probably the most important part of treating AF. The benefits of this type of treatment have been proven in multiple studies.
                
Doctors prescribe blood-thinning medicines to prevent blood clots. These medicines include warfarin (Coumadin), dabigatran, heparin, and aspirin.
                
People taking blood-thinning medicines need regular blood tests to check how well the medicines are working.
                
Rate Control
                
Doctors can prescribe medicines to slow down the rate at which the ventricles are beating. These medicines help bring the heart rate to a normal level.
                
Rate control is the recommended treatment for most patients who have AF, even though an abnormal heart rhythm continues and the heart doesn't work as well as it should. Most people feel better and can function well if their heart rates are well-controlled.
                
Medicines used to control the heart rate include beta blockers (for example, metoprolol and atenolol), calcium channel blockers (diltiazem and verapamil), and digitalis (digoxin). Several other medicines also are available.
                
Rhythm Control
                
Restoring and maintaining a normal heart rhythm is a treatment approach recommended for people who aren't doing well with rate control treatment. This treatment also may be used for people who have only recently started having AF. The long-term benefits of rhythm control have not been proven conclusively yet.
                
Doctors use medicines or procedures to control the heart's rhythm. Patients often begin rhythm control treatment in a hospital so that their hearts can be closely watched.
                
The longer you have AF, the less likely it is that doctors can restore a normal heart rhythm. This is especially true for people who have had AF for 6 months or more.
                
Restoring a normal rhythm also becomes less likely if the atria are enlarged or if any underlying heart disease worsens. In these cases, the chance that AF will recur is high, even if you're taking medicine to help convert AF to a normal rhythm.
                
Medicines. Medicines used to control the heart rhythm include amiodarone, sotalol, flecainide, propafenone, dofetilide, and ibutilide. Sometimes older medicinessuch as quinidine, procainamide, and disopyramideare used.
                
Your doctor will carefully tailor the dose and type of medicines he or she prescribes to treat your AF. This is because medicines used to treat AF can cause a different kind of arrhythmia.
                
These medicines also can harm people who have underlying diseases of the heart or other organs. This is especially true for patients who have an unusual heart rhythm problem called Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.
                
Your doctor may start you on a small dose of medicine and then gradually increase the dose until your symptoms are controlled. Medicines used for rhythm control can be given regularly by injection at a doctor's office, clinic, or hospital. Or, you may routinely take pills to try to control AF or prevent repeat episodes.
                
If your doctor knows how you'll react to a medicine, a specific dose may be prescribed for you to take on an as-needed basis if you have an episode of AF.
                
Procedures. Doctors use several procedures to restore a normal heart rhythm. For example, they may use electrical cardioversion to treat a fast or irregular heartbeat. For this procedure, low-energy shocks are given to your heart to trigger a normal rhythm. You're temporarily put to sleep before you receive the shocks.
                
Electrical cardioversion isn't the same as the emergency heart shocking procedure often seen on TV programs. It's planned in advance and done under carefully controlled conditions.
                
Before doing electrical cardioversion, your doctor may recommend transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). This test can rule out the presence of blood clots in the atria. If clots are present, you may need to take blood-thinning medicines before the procedure. These medicines can help get rid of the clots.
                
Catheter ablation (ab-LA-shun) may be used to restore a normal heart rhythm if medicines or electrical cardioversion don't work. For this procedure, a wire is inserted through a vein in the leg or arm and threaded to the heart.
                
Radio wave energy is sent through the wire to destroy abnormal tissue that may be disrupting the normal flow of electrical signals. An electrophysiologist usually does this procedure in a hospital. Your doctor may recommend a TEE before catheter ablation to check for blood clots in the atria.
                
Sometimes doctors use catheter ablation to destroy the atrioventricular (AV) node. The AV node is where the heart's electrical signals pass from the atria to the ventricles (the heart's lower chambers). This procedure requires your doctor to surgically implant a device called a pacemaker, which helps maintain a normal heart rhythm.
                
Research on the benefits of catheter ablation as a treatment for AF is still ongoing. (For more information, go to the ""Clinical Trials"" section of this article.)
                
Another procedure to restore a normal heart rhythm is called maze surgery. For this procedure, the surgeon makes small cuts or burns in the atria. These cuts or burns prevent the spread of disorganized electrical signals.
                
This procedure requires open-heart surgery, so it's usually done when a person requires heart surgery for other reasons, such as for heart valve disease (which can increase the risk of AF).
                
Approaches To Treating Underlying Causes and Reducing Risk Factors
                
Your doctor may recommend treatments for an underlying cause of AF or to reduce AF risk factors. For example, he or she may prescribe medicines to treat an overactive thyroid, lower high blood pressure, or manage high blood cholesterol.
                
Your doctor also may recommend lifestyle changes, such as following a healthy diet, cutting back on salt intake (to help lower blood pressure), quitting smoking, and reducing stress.
                
Limiting or avoiding alcohol, caffeine, or other stimulants that may increase your heart rate also can help reduce your risk for AF.",treatment,Atrial Fibrillation,What are the treatments for Atrial Fibrillation ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/af,"Following a healthy lifestyle and taking steps to lower your risk for heart disease may help you prevent atrial fibrillation (AF). These steps include:
                
Following a heart healthy diet that's low in saturated fat, trans fat, and cholesterol. A healthy diet includes a variety of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables daily.
                
Not smoking.
                
Being physically active.
                
Maintaining a healthy weight.
                
If you already have heart disease or other AF risk factors, work with your doctor to manage your condition. In addition to adopting the healthy habits above, which can help control heart disease, your doctor may advise you to: 
                
Follow the DASH eating plan to help lower your blood pressure.
                
Keep your cholesterol and triglycerides at healthy levels with dietary changes and medicines (if prescribed).
                
Limit or avoid alcohol.
                
Control your blood sugar level if you have diabetes.

NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/brn,"Bronchiectasis often is treated with medicines, hydration, and chest physical therapy (CPT). Your doctor may recommend surgery if the bronchiectasis is isolated to a section of lung or you have a lot of bleeding.
                
If the bronchiectasis is widespread and causing respiratory failure, your doctor may recommend oxygen therapy.
                
The goals of treatment are to:
                
Treat any underlying conditions and lung infections.
                
Remove mucus (a slimy substance) from your lungs. Maintaining good hydration helps with mucus removal.
                
Prevent complications.
                
Early diagnosis and treatment of the underlying cause of bronchiectasis may help prevent further lung damage.
                
In addition, any disease associated with the bronchiectasis, such as cystic fibrosisor immunodeficiency, also should be treated.
                
Medicines
                
Your doctor may prescribe antibiotics, bronchodilators, expectorants, or mucus-thinning medicines to treat bronchiectasis.
                
Antibiotics
                
Antibiotics are the main treatment for the repeated lung infections that bronchiectasis causes. Oral antibiotics often are used to treat these infections.
                
For hard-to-treat infections, your doctor may prescribe intravenous (IV) antibiotics. These medicines are given through an IV line inserted into your arm. Your doctor may help you arrange for a home care provider to give you IV antibiotics at home.
                
Expectorants and Mucus-Thinning Medicines
                
Your doctor may prescribe expectorants and mucus thinners to help you cough up mucus.
                
Expectorants help loosen the mucus in your lungs. They often are combined with decongestants, which may provide extra relief. Mucus thinners, such as acetylcysteine, loosen the mucus to make it easier to cough up.
                
For some of these treatments, little information is available to show how well they work.
                
Hydration
                
Drinking plenty of fluid, especially water, helps prevent airway mucus from becoming thick and sticky. Good hydration helps keep airway mucus moist and slippery, which makes it easier to cough up.
                
Chest Physical Therapy
                
CPT also is called physiotherapy (FIZ-e-o-THER-ah-pe) or chest clapping or percussion. This technique is generally performed by a respiratory therapist but can be done by a trained member of the family. It involves the therapist pounding your chest and back over and over with his or her hands or a device. Doing this helps loosen the mucus from your lungs so you can cough it up.
                
You can sit with your head tilted down or lie on your stomach with your head down while you do CPT. Gravity and force help drain the mucus from your lungs.
                
Some people find CPT hard or uncomfortable to do. Several devices can help with CPT, such as:
                
An electric chest clapper, known as a mechanical percussor.
                
An inflatable therapy vest that uses high-frequency air waves to force mucus toward your upper airways so you can cough it up.
                
A small handheld device that you breathe out through. It causes vibrations that dislodge the mucus.
                
A mask that creates vibrations to help break loose mucus from your airway walls.
                
Some of these methods and devices are popular with patients and doctors, but little information is available on how well they actually work. Choice usually is based on convenience and cost.
                
Several breathing techniques also are used to help move mucus to the upper airway so it can be coughed up. These techniques include forced expiration technique (FET) and active cycle breathing (ACB).
                
FET involves forcing out a couple of breaths and then doing relaxed breathing. ACB is FET that involves deep breathing exercises.
                
Other Treatments
                
Depending on your condition, your doctor also may recommend bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids, oxygen therapy, or surgery.
                
Bronchodilators
                
Bronchodilators relax the muscles around your airways. This helps open your airways and makes breathing easier. Most bronchodilators are inhaled medicines. You will use an inhaler or a nebulizer to breathe in a fine mist of medicine.
                
Inhaled bronchodilators work quickly because the medicine goes straight to your lungs. Your doctor may recommend that you use a bronchodilator right before you do CPT.
                
Inhaled Corticosteroids
                
If you also have wheezing or asthma with your bronchiectasis, your doctor may prescribe inhaled corticosteroids (used to treat inflammation in the airways).
                
Oxygen Therapy
                
Oxygen therapy can help raise low blood oxygen levels. For this treatment, you'll receive oxygen through nasal prongs or a mask. Oxygen therapy can be done at home, in a hospital, or in another health facility. (For more information, go to the Health Topics Oxygen Therapy article.)
                
Surgery
                
Your doctor may recommend surgery if no other treatments have helped and only one part of your airway is affected. If you have major bleeding in your airway, your doctor may recommend surgery to remove part of your airway or a procedure to control the bleeding.
                
In very rare instances of severe bronchiectasis, your doctor may recommend that you receive a lung transplant replacing your diseased lungs with a healthy set of lungs.",treatment,Bronchiectasis,What are the treatments for Bronchiectasis ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/brn,"To prevent bronchiectasis, it's important to prevent the lung infections and lung damage that can cause it.
                
Childhood vaccines for measles and whooping cough prevent infections related to these illnesses. These vaccines also reduce complications from these infections, such as bronchiectasis.
                
Avoiding toxic fumes, gases, smoke, and other harmful substances also can help protect your lungs.
                
Proper treatment of lung infections in children also may help preserve lung function and prevent lung damage that can lead to bronchiectasis.
                
Stay alert to keep children (and adults) from inhaling small objects (such as pieces of toys and food that might stick in a small airway). If you think you, your child, or someone else has inhaled a small object, seek prompt medical care.

NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/bpd,"Preventive Measures
                
If your doctor thinks you're going to give birth too early, he or she may give you injections of a corticosteroid medicine.
                
The medicine can speed up surfactant production in your baby. Surfactant is a liquid that coats the inside of the lungs. It helps keep the lungs open so your infant can breathe in air once he or she is born.
                
Corticosteroids also can help your baby's lungs, brain, and kidneys develop more quickly while he or she is in the womb.
                
Premature babies who have very low birth weights also might be given corticosteroids within the first few days of birth. Doctors sometimes prescribe inhaled nitric oxide shortly after birth for babies who have very low birth weights. This treatment can help improve the babies' lung function.
                
These preventive measures may help reduce infants' risk of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), which can lead to BPD.
                
Treatment for Respiratory Distress Syndrome
                
The goals of treating infants who have RDS include:
                
Reducing further injury to the lungs
                
Providing nutrition and other support to help the lungs grow and recover
                
Preventing lung infections by giving antibiotics
                
Treatment of RDS usually begins as soon as an infant is born, sometimes in the delivery room. Most infants who have signs of RDS are quickly moved to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). They receive around-the-clock treatment from health care professionals who specialize in treating premature infants.
                
Treatments for RDS include surfactant replacement therapy, breathing support with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) or a ventilator, oxygen therapy (oxygen given through nasal prongs, a mask, or a breathing tube), and medicines to treat fluid buildup in the lungs.
                
For more information about RDS treatments, go to the Health Topics Respiratory Distress Syndrome article.
                
Treatment for Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia
                
Treatment in the NICU is designed to limit stress on infants and meet their basic needs of warmth, nutrition, and protection. Once doctors diagnose BPD, some or all of the treatments used for RDS will continue in the NICU.
                
Such treatment usually includes:
                
Using radiant warmers or incubators to keep infants warm and reduce the risk of infection.
                
Ongoing monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, breathing, and temperature through sensors taped to the babies' bodies.
                
Using sensors on fingers or toes to check the amount of oxygen in the infants' blood.
                
Giving fluids and nutrients through needles or tubes inserted into the infants' veins. This helps prevent malnutrition and promotes growth. Nutrition is vital to the growth and development of the lungs. Later, babies may be given breast milk or infant formula through feeding tubes that are passed through their noses or mouths and into their throats.
                
Checking fluid intake to make sure that fluid doesn't build up in the babies' lungs.
                
As BPD improves, babies are slowly weaned off NCPAP or ventilators until they can breathe on their own. These infants will likely need oxygen therapy for some time.
                
If your infant has moderate or severe BPD, echocardiography might be done every few weeks to months to check his or her pulmonary artery pressure.
                
If your child needs long-term ventilator support, he or she will likely get a tracheostomy (TRA-ke-OS-toe-me). A tracheostomy is a surgically made hole. It goes through the front of the neck and into the trachea (TRA-ke-ah), or windpipe. Your child's doctor will put the breathing tube from the ventilator through the hole.
                
Using a tracheostomy instead of an endotracheal (en-do-TRA-ke-al) tube has some advantages. (An endotracheal tube is a breathing tube inserted through the nose or mouth and into the windpipe.)
                
Long-term use of an endotracheal tube can damage the trachea. This damage may need to be corrected with surgery later. A tracheostomy can allow your baby to interact more with you and the NICU staff, start talking, and develop other skills.
                
While your baby is in the NICU, he or she also may need physical therapy. Physical therapy can help strengthen your child's muscles and clear mucus out of his or her lungs.
                
Infants who have BPD may spend several weeks or months in the hospital. This allows them to get the care they need.
                
Before your baby goes home, learn as much as you can about your child's condition and how it's treated. Your baby may continue to have some breathing symptoms after he or she leaves the hospital.
                
Your child will likely continue on all or some of the treatments that were started at the hospital, including:
                
Medicines, such as bronchodilators, steroids, and diuretics.
                
Oxygen therapy or breathing support from NCPAP or a ventilator.
                
Extra nutrition and calories, which may be given through a feeding tube.
                
Preventive treatment with a medicine called palivizumab for severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). This common virus leads to mild, cold-like symptoms in adults and older, healthy children. However, in infantsespecially those in high-risk groupsRSV can lead to severe breathing problems.
                
Your child also should have regular checkups with and timely vaccinations from a pediatrician. This is a doctor who specializes in treating children. If your child needs oxygen therapy or a ventilator at home, a pulmonary specialist might be involved in his or her care.
                
Seek out support from family, friends, and hospital staff. Ask the case manager or social worker at the hospital about what you'll need after your baby leaves the hospital.

Seeing your doctor regularly during your pregnancy
                
Following a healthy diet
                
Not smoking and avoiding tobacco smoke, alcohol, and illegal drugs
                
Controlling any ongoing medical conditions you have
                
Preventing infection
                
If your doctor thinks that you're going to give birth too early, he or she may give you injections of a corticosteroid medicine.
                
The medicine can speed up surfactant production in your baby. Surfactant is a liquid that coats the inside of the lungs. It helps keep them open so your infant can breathe in air once he or she is born.
                
Usually, within about 24 hours of your taking this medicine, the baby's lungs start making enough surfactant. This will reduce the infant's risk of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), which can lead to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).
                
Corticosteroids also can help your baby's lungs, brain, and kidneys develop more quickly while he or she is in the womb.
                
If your baby does develop RDS, it will probably be fairly mild. If the RDS isn't mild, BPD will likely develop.",prevention,Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia,How to prevent Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/thalassemia,"Treatments for thalassemias depend on the type and severity of the disorder. People who are carriers or who have alpha or beta thalassemia trait have mild or no symptoms. Theyll likely need little or no treatment.
                
Doctors use three standard treatments for moderate and severe forms of thalassemia. These treatments include blood transfusions, iron chelation (ke-LAY-shun) therapy, and folic acid supplements. Other treatments have been developed or are being tested, but they're used much less often.
                
Standard Treatments
                
Blood Transfusions
                
Transfusions of red blood cells are the main treatment for people who have moderate or severe thalassemias. This treatment gives you healthy red blood cells with normal hemoglobin.
                
During a blood transfusion, a needle is used to insert an intravenous (IV) line into one of your blood vessels. Through this line, you receive healthy blood. The procedure usually takes 1 to 4 hours.
                
Red blood cells live only for about 120 days. So, you may need repeated transfusions to maintain a healthy supply of red blood cells.
                
If you have hemoglobin H disease or beta thalassemia intermedia, you may need blood transfusions on occasion. For example, you may have transfusions when you have an infection or other illness, or when your anemia is severe enough to cause tiredness.
                
If you have beta thalassemia major (Cooley's anemia), youll likely need regular blood transfusions (often every 2 to 4 weeks). These transfusions will help you maintain normal hemoglobin and red blood cell levels.
                
Blood transfusions allow you to feel better, enjoy normal activities, and live into adulthood. This treatment is lifesaving, but it's expensive and carries a risk of transmitting infections and viruses (for example, hepatitis). However, the risk is very low in the United States because of careful blood screening.
                
For more information, go to the Health Topics Blood Transfusion article.
                
Iron Chelation Therapy
                
The hemoglobin in red blood cells is an iron-rich protein. Thus, regular blood transfusions can lead to a buildup of iron in the blood. This condition is called iron overload. It damages the liver, heart, and other parts of the body.
                
To prevent this damage, doctors use iron chelation therapy to remove excess iron from the body. Two medicines are used for iron chelation therapy.
                
Deferoxamine is a liquid medicine that's given slowly under the skin, usually with a small portable pump used overnight. This therapy takes time and can be mildly painful. Side effects include problems with vision and hearing.
                
Deferasirox is a pill taken once daily. Side effects include headache, nausea (feeling sick to the stomach), vomiting, diarrhea, joint pain, and tiredness.
                
Folic Acid Supplements
                
Folic acid is a B vitamin that helps build healthy red blood cells. Your doctor may recommend folic acid supplements in addition to treatment with blood transfusions and/or iron chelation therapy.
                
Other Treatments
                
Other treatments for thalassemias have been developed or are being tested, but they're used much less often.
                
Blood and Marrow Stem Cell Transplant
                
A blood and marrow stem cell transplant replaces faulty stem cells with healthy ones from another person (a donor). Stem cells are the cells inside bone marrow that make red blood cells and other types of blood cells.
                
A stem cell transplant is the only treatment that can cure thalassemia. But only a small number of people who have severe thalassemias are able to find a good donor match and have the risky procedure.
                
For more information, go to the Health Topics Blood and Marrow Stem Cell Transplant article.
                
Possible Future Treatments
                
Researchers are working to find new treatments for thalassemias. For example, it might be possible someday to insert a normal hemoglobin gene into stem cells in bone marrow. This will allow people who have thalassemias to make their own healthy red blood cells and hemoglobin.
                
Researchers also are studying ways to trigger a person's ability to make fetal hemoglobin after birth. This type of hemoglobin is found in fetuses and newborns. After birth, the body switches to making adult hemoglobin. Making more fetal hemoglobin might make up for the lack of healthy adult hemoglobin.
                
Treating Complications
                
Better treatments now allow people who have moderate and severe thalassemias to live longer. As a result, these people must cope with complications that occur over time.
                
An important part of managing thalassemias is treating complications. Treatment might be needed for heart or liver diseases, infections, osteoporosis, and other health problems.",treatment,Thalassemias,What are the treatments for Thalassemias ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/thalassemia,"You cant prevent thalassemias because theyre inherited (passed from parents to children through genes). However, prenatal tests can detect these blood disorders before birth.
                
Family genetic studies may help find out whether people have missing or altered hemoglobin genes that cause thalassemias. (For more information, go to ""How Are Thalassemias Diagnosed?"")

NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/hbp,"Based on your diagnosis, health care providers develop treatment plans for high blood pressure that include lifelong lifestyle changes and medicines to control high blood pressure; lifestyle changes such as weight loss can be highly effective in treating high blood pressure.
                

                
Treatment Plans
                
Health care providers work with you to develop a treatment plan based on whether you were diagnosed with primary or secondary high blood pressure and if there is a suspected or known cause. Treatment plans may evolve until blood pressure control is achieved.
                
If your health care provider diagnoses you with secondary high blood pressure, he or she will work to treat the other condition or change the medicine suspected of causing your high blood pressure. If high blood pressure persists or is first diagnosed as primary high blood pressure, your treatment plan will include lifestyle changes. When lifestyle changes alone do not control or lower blood pressure, your health care provider may change or update your treatment plan by prescribing medicines to treat the disease. Health care providers prescribe children and teens medicines at special doses that are safe and effective in children.
                
If your health care provider prescribes medicines as a part of your treatment plan, keep up your healthy lifestyle habits. The combination of the medicines and the healthy lifestyle habits helps control and lower your high blood pressure.
                
Some people develop resistant or uncontrolled high blood pressure. This can happen when the medications they are taking do not work well for them or another medical condition is leading to uncontrolled blood pressure. Health care providers treat resistant or uncontrolled high blood pressure with an intensive treatment plan that can include a different set of blood pressure medications or other special treatments.
                
To achieve the best control of your blood pressure, follow your treatment plan and take all medications as prescribed. Following your prescribed treatment plan is important because it can prevent or delay complications that high blood pressure can cause and can lower your risk for other related problems.
                

                
Healthy Lifestyle Changes
                
Healthy lifestyle habits can help you control high blood pressure. These habits include:
                
Healthy eating
                
Being physically active
                
Maintaining a healthy weight
                
Limiting alcohol intake
                
Managing and coping with stress
                
To help make lifelong lifestyle changes, try making one healthy lifestyle change at a time and add another change when you feel that you have successfully adopted the earlier changes. When you practice several healthy lifestyle habits, you are more likely to lower your blood pressure and maintain normal blood pressure readings.
                

                
Healthy Eating
                
To help treat high blood pressure, health care providers recommend that you limit sodium and salt intake, increase potassium, and eat foods that are heart healthy.
                
Limiting Sodium and Salt
                
A low-sodium diet can help you manage your blood pressure. You should try to limit the amount of sodium that you eat. This means choosing and preparing foods that are lower in salt and sodium. Try to use low-sodium and no added salt foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. Food labels tell you what you need to know about choosing foods that are lower in sodium. Try to eat no more than 2,300 mg sodium a day. If you have high blood pressure, you may need to restrict your sodium intake even more.
                
Your health care provider may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan if you have high blood pressure. The DASH eating plan focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and low in fat, cholesterol, and salt.
                
The DASH eating plan is a good heart-healthy eating plan, even for those who dont have high blood pressure. Read more about the DASH eating plan.
                
Heart-Healthy Eating
                
Your health care provider also may recommend heart-healthy eating, which should include:
                
Whole grains
                
Fruits, such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes
                
Vegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and carrots
                
Legumes, such as kidney beans, lentils, chick peas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans
                
Fat-free or low-fat dairy products, such as skim milk
                
Fish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and trout, about twice a week
                
When following a heart-healthy diet, you should avoid eating:
                
A lot of red meat
                
Palm and coconut oils
                
Sugary foods and beverages
                
In the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)-sponsored Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos, which studied Hispanics living in the United States, Cubans ate more sodium and Mexicans ate less sodium than other Hispanic groups in the study. All Hispanic Americans should follow these healthy eating recommendations even when cooking traditional Latino dishes. Try some of these popular Hispanic American heart-healthy recipes.
                

                
Being Physically Active
                
Routine physical activity can lower high blood pressure and reduce your risk for other health problems. Talk with your health care provider before you start a new exercise plan. Ask him or her how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you.
                
Everyone should try to participate in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2 hours and 30minutes per week, or vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise for 1 hour and 15 minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats harder and you use more oxygen than usual. The more active you are, the more you will benefit. Participate in aerobic exercise for at least 10 minutes at a time, spread throughout the week.

Maintaining a Healthy Weight
                
Maintaining a healthy weight can help you control high blood pressure and reduce your risk for other health problems. If youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. A loss of just 3 to 5 percent can lower your risk for health problems. Greater amounts of weight loss can improve blood pressure readings, lowerLDL cholesterol, and increase HDL cholesterol. However, research shows that no matter your weight, it is important to control high blood pressure to maintain good health.
                
A useful measure of overweight and obesity is body mass index (BMI). BMI measures your weight in relation to your height. To figure out your BMI, check out NHLBIs online BMI calculator or talk to yourhealth care provider.
                
A BMI:
                
Below 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight.
                
Between 18.5 and 24.9 is in the healthy range.
                
Between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight.
                
Of 30 or more is considered obese.
                
A general goal to aim for is a BMI below 25. Your health care provider can help you set an appropriate BMI goal.
                
Measuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. If most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type 2 diabetes. This risk may be high with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. To learn how to measure your waist, visit Assessing Your Weight and Health Risk. For more information about losing weight or maintaining your weight, go to Aim for a Healthy Weight.
                

                
Limiting Alcohol Intake
                
Limit alcohol intake. Too much alcohol will raise your blood pressure and triglyceride levels, a type of fat found in the blood. Alcohol also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain.
                
Men should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day. Women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day. One drink is:
                
12 ounces of beer
                
5 ounces of wine
                
1 ounces of liquor
                
Managing and Coping With Stress
                
Learning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health and can lower high blood pressure. Stress management techniques include:
                
Being physically active
                
Listening to music or focusing on something calm or peaceful
                
Performing yoga or tai chi
                
Meditating
                

                
Medicines
                
Blood pressure medicines work in different ways to stop or slow some of the bodys functions that cause high blood pressure. Medicines to lower blood pressure include:
                
Diuretics (Water or Fluid Pills): Flush excess sodium from your body, which reduces the amount of fluid in your blood and helps to lower your blood pressure. Diuretics are often used with other high blood pressure medicines, sometimes in one combined pill.
                
Beta Blockers: Help your heart beat slower and with less force. As a result, your heart pumps less blood through your blood vessels, which can help to lower your blood pressure.
                
Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors: Angiotensin-II is a hormone that narrows blood vessels, increasing blood pressure. ACE converts Angiotensin I to Angiotensin II. ACE inhibitors block this process, which stops the production of Angiotensin II, lowering blood pressure.
                
Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs): Block angiotensin II hormone from binding with receptors in the blood vessels. When angiotensin II is blocked, the blood vessels do not constrict or narrow, which can lower your blood pressure.
                
Calcium Channel Blockers: Keep calcium from entering the muscle cells of your heart and blood vessels. This allows blood vessels to relax, which can lower your blood pressure.
                
Alpha Blockers: Reduce nerve impulses that tighten blood vessels. This allows blood to flow more freely, causing blood pressure to go down.
                
Alpha-Beta Blockers: Reduce nerve impulses the same way alpha blockers do. However, like beta blockers, they also slow the heartbeat. As a result, blood pressure goes down.
                
Central Acting Agents: Act in the brain to decrease nerve signals that narrow blood vessels, which can lower blood pressure.
                
Vasodilators: Relax the muscles in blood vessel walls, which can lower blood pressure.
                
To lower and control blood pressure, many people take two or more medicines. If you have side effects from your medicines, dont stop taking your medicines. Instead, talk with your health care provider about the side effects to see if the dose can be changed or a new medicine prescribed.
                
Future Treatments
                
Scientists, doctors, and researchers continue to study the changes that cause high blood pressure, to develop new medicines and treatments to control high blood pressure.

NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/inso,"Lifestyle changes often can help relieve acute (short-term) insomnia. These changes might make it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep.
                
A type of counseling called cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can help relieve the anxiety linked to chronic (ongoing) insomnia. Anxiety tends to prolong insomnia.
                
Several medicines also can help relieve insomnia and re-establish a regular sleep schedule. However, if your insomnia is the symptom or side effect of another problem, it's important to treat the underlying cause (if possible).
                
Lifestyle Changes
                
If you have insomnia, avoid substances that make it worse, such as:
                
Caffeine, tobacco, and other stimulants. The effects of these substances can last as long as 8 hours.
                
Certain over-the-counter and prescription medicines that can disrupt sleep (for example, some cold and allergy medicines). Talk with your doctor about which medicines won't disrupt your sleep.
                
Alcohol. An alcoholic drink before bedtime might make it easier for you to fall asleep. However, alcohol triggers sleep that tends to be lighter than normal. This makes it more likely that you will wake up during the night.
                
Try to adopt bedtime habits that make it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep. Follow a routine that helps you wind down and relax before bed. For example, read a book, listen to soothing music, or take a hot bath.
                
Try to schedule your daily exercise at least 5 to 6 hours before going to bed. Don't eat heavy meals or drink a lot before bedtime.
                
Make your bedroom sleep-friendly. Avoid bright lighting while winding down. Try to limit possible distractions, such as a TV, computer, or pet. Make sure the temperature of your bedroom is cool and comfortable. Your bedroom also should be dark and quiet.
                
Go to sleep around the same time each night and wake up around the same time each morning, even on weekends. If you can, avoid night shifts, alternating schedules, or other things that may disrupt your sleep schedule.
                
Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy
                
CBT for insomnia targets the thoughts and actions that can disrupt sleep. This therapy encourages good sleep habits and uses several methods to relieve sleep anxiety.
                
For example, relaxation techniques and biofeedback are used to reduce anxiety. These strategies help you better control your breathing, heart rate, muscles, and mood.
                
CBT also aims to replace sleep anxiety with more positive thinking that links being in bed with being asleep. This method also teaches you what to do if you're unable to fall asleep within a reasonable time.
                
CBT also may involve talking with a therapist one-on-one or in group sessions to help you consider your thoughts and feelings about sleep. This method may encourage you to describe thoughts racing through your mind in terms of how they look, feel, and sound. The goal is for your mind to settle down and stop racing.
                
CBT also focuses on limiting the time you spend in bed while awake. This method involves setting a sleep schedule. At first, you will limit your total time in bed to the typical short length of time you're usually asleep.
                
This schedule might make you even more tired because some of the allotted time in bed will be taken up by problems falling asleep. However, the resulting tiredness is intended to help you get to sleep more quickly. Over time, the length of time spent in bed is increased until you get a full night of sleep.
                
For success with CBT, you may need to see a therapist who is skilled in this approach weekly over 2 to 3 months. CBT works as well as prescription medicine for many people who have chronic insomnia. It also may provide better long-term relief than medicine alone.
                
For people who have insomnia and major depressive disorder, CBT combined with antidepression medicines has shown promise in relieving both conditions.
                
Medicines
                
Prescription Medicines
                
Many prescription medicines are used to treat insomnia. Some are meant for short-term use, while others are meant for longer use.
                
Talk to your doctor about the benefits and side effects of insomnia medicines. For example, insomnia medicines can help you fall asleep, but you may feel groggy in the morning after taking them.
                
Rare side effects of these medicines include sleep eating, sleep walking, or driving while asleep. If you have side effects from an insomnia medicine, or if it doesn't work well, tell your doctor. He or she might prescribe a different medicine.
                
Some insomnia medicines can be habit forming. Ask your doctor about the benefits and risks of insomnia medicines.
                
Over-the-Counter Products
                
Some over-the-counter (OTC) products claim to treat insomnia. These products include melatonin, L-tryptophan supplements, and valerian teas or extracts.
                
The Food and Drug Administration doesn't regulate natural products and some food supplements. Thus, the dose and purity of these substances can vary. How well these products work and how safe they are isn't well understood.
                
Some OTC products that contain antihistamines are sold as sleep aids. Although these products might make you sleepy, talk to your doctor before taking them.

If lifestyle changes arent enough, your doctor may prescribe medicines. Medicines are used to treat and control risk factors, such as high blood pressure, high triglycerides, low HDL (good) cholesterol, and high blood sugar.
                
Goals of Treatment
                
The major goal of treating metabolic syndrome is to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease. Treatment is directed first at lowering LDL cholesterol and high blood pressure and managing diabetes (if these conditions are present).
                
The second goal of treatment is to prevent the onset of type2 diabetes, if it hasnt already developed. Long-term complications of diabetes often include heart and kidney disease, vision loss, and foot or leg amputation. If diabetes is present, the goal of treatment is to reduce your risk for heart disease by controlling all of your risk factors.
                

                
Heart-Healthy Lifestyle Changes
                
Heart-Healthy Eating
                
Heart-healthy eating is an important part of a heart-healthy lifestyle. Your doctor may recommend heart-healthy eating, which should include:
                
Fat-free or low-fat dairy products, such as skim milk
                
Fish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and trout, about twice a week
                
Fruits, such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes
                
Legumes, such as kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans
                
Vegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and carrots
                
Whole grains, such as oatmeal, brown rice, and corn tortillas
                
When following a heart-healthy diet, you should avoid eating:
                
A lot of red meat
                
Palm and coconut oils
                
Sugary foods and beverages
                
Two nutrients in your diet make blood cholesterol levels rise:
                
Saturated fatfound mostly in foods that come from animals
                
Trans fat (trans fatty acids)found in foods made with hydrogenated oils and fats, such as stick margarine; baked goods, such as cookies, cakes, and pies; crackers; frostings; and coffee creamers. Some trans fats also occur naturally in animal fats and meats.
                
Saturated fat raises your blood cholesterol more than anything else in your diet. When you follow a heart-healthy eating plan, only 5percent to 6percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. Food labels list the amounts of saturated fat. To help you stay on track, here are some examples:
                
If you eat:
                
Try to eat no more than:
                
1,200 calories a day                     
                
8 grams of saturated fat a day            
                
1,500 calories a day
                
10 grams of saturated fat a day
                
1,800 calories a day
                
12 grams of saturated fat a day
                
2,000 calories a day
                
13 grams of saturated fat a day
                
2,500 calories a day
                
17 grams of saturated fat a day
                
Not all fats are bad. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats actually help lower blood cholesterol levels. Some sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are:
                
Avocados
                
Corn, sunflower, and soybean oils
                
Nuts and seeds, such as walnuts
                
Olive, canola, peanut, safflower, and sesame oils
                
Peanut butter
                
Salmon and trout
                
Tofu
                
Sodium
                
You should try to limit the amount of sodium that you eat. This means choosing and preparing foods that are lower in salt and sodium. Try to use low-sodium and no added salt foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. Food labels tell you what you need to know about choosing foods that are lower in sodium. Try to eat no more than 2,300milligrams of sodium a day. If you have high blood pressure, you may need to restrict your sodium intake even more.
                
Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension
                
Your doctor may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan if you have high blood pressure. The DASH eating plan focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and low in fat, cholesterol, and sodium and salt.
                
The DASH eating plan is a good heart-healthy eating plan, even for those who dont have high blood pressure. Read more about DASH.
                
Limiting Alcohol
                
Try to limit alcohol intake. Too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure and triglyceride levels, a type of fat found in the blood. Alcohol also adds extra calories, which may cause weightgain.
                
Men should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day. Women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day. One drink is:
                
12 ounces of beer
                
5 ounces of wine
                
1 ounces of liquor
                

                
Maintaining a Healthy Weight
                
If you have metabolic syndrome and are overweight or obese, your doctor will recommend weight loss. He or she can help you create a weight-loss plan and goals. Maintaining a healthy weight can lower your risk for metabolic syndrome, coronary heart disease, and other health problems. Aim for a Healthy Weight by following a heart-healthy eating plan and keeping physically active.
                
Knowing your body mass index (BMI) helps you find out if youre a healthy weight in relation to your height and gives an estimate of your total body fat. To figure out your BMI, check out the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes (NHLBI) online BMI calculator or talk to your doctor. A BMI:
                
Below 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight.
                
Between 18.5 and 24.9 is in the normal range.
                
Between 25.0 and 29.9 is considered overweight.
                
Of 30.0 or higher is considered obese.
                
A general goal to aim for is a BMI of less than 25. Your doctor or health care provider can help you set an appropriate BMI goal.
                
Measuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. If most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type2 diabetes. This risk may be higher with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men.
                
If youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. A loss of just 3percent to 5percent of your current weight can lower your triglycerides, blood glucose, and the risk of developing type2 diabetes. Greater amounts of weight loss can improve blood pressure readings, lower LDL (bad) cholesterol, and increase HDL cholesterol.
                

                
Managing Stress
                
Learning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health. Consider healthy stress-reducing activities, such as:
                
A stress management program
                
Meditation
                
Physical activity
                
Relaxation therapy
                
Talking things out with friends or family
                

                
Physical Activity
                
Regular physical activity can lower your risk for metabolic syndrome, coronary heart disease, and other health problems. Everyone should try to participate in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2hours and 30minutes per week or vigorous aerobic exercise for 1hour and 15minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats faster and you use more oxygen than usual. The more active you are, the more you will benefit. Participate in aerobic exercise for at least 10minutes at a time spread throughout the week.
                
Talk with your doctor before you start a new exercise plan. Ask your doctor how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you.

Quitting Smoking
                
If you smoke, quit. Smoking can raise your risk for heart disease and heart attack and worsen other heart disease risk factors. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke.
                
If you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking. For more information about how to quit smoking, go to the Smoking and Your Heart Health Topic.
                

                
Medicines
                
Sometimes lifestyle changes arent enough to control your risk factors for metabolic syndrome. For example, you may need statin medications to control or lower your cholesterol. By lowering your blood cholesterol level, you can decrease your chance of having a heart attack or stroke. Doctors usually prescribe statins for people who have:
                
Diabetes
                
Heart disease or had a prior stroke
                
High LDL cholesterol levels
                
Doctors may discuss beginning statin treatment with those who have an elevated risk for developing heart disease or having a stroke.
                
Your doctor also may prescribe other medications to:
                
Decrease your chance of having a heart attack or dying suddenly.
                
Lower your blood pressure.
                
Prevent blood clots, which can lead to heart attack or stroke.
                
Reduce your hearts workload and relieve symptoms of coronary heart disease.
                
Take all medicines regularly, as your doctor prescribes. Dont change the amount of your medicine or skip a dose unless your doctor tells you to. You should still follow a heart-healthy lifestyle, even if you take medicines to treat your risk factors for metabolic syndrome.",treatment,Metabolic Syndrome,What are the treatments for Metabolic Syndrome ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/ms,"Making heart-healthy lifestyle choices is the best way to prevent metabolic syndrome by:
                
Being physically active
                
Following a heart-healthy eating plan
                
Knowing your weight, waist measurement, and body mass index
                
Maintaining a healthy weight
                
Make sure to schedule routine doctor visits to keep track of your cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar levels.

NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/aat,"Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency has no cure, but its related lung diseases have many treatments. Most of these treatments are the same as the ones used for a lung disease called COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).
                
If you have symptoms related to AAT deficiency, your doctor may recommend:
                
Medicines called inhaled bronchodilators (brong-ko-di-LA-tors) and inhaled steroids. These medicines help open your airways and make breathing easier. They also are used to treat asthma and COPD.
                
Flu and pneumococcal (noo-mo-KOK-al) vaccines to protect you from illnesses that could make your condition worse. Prompt treatment of lung infections also can help protect your lungs.
                
Pulmonary rehabilitation (rehab). Rehab involves treatment by a team of experts at a special clinic. In rehab, you'll learn how to manage your condition and function at your best.
                
Extra oxygen, if needed.
                
A lung transplant. A lung transplant may be an option if you have severe breathing problems. If you have a good chance of surviving the transplant surgery, you may be a candidate for it.
                
Augmentation (og-men-TA-shun) therapy is a treatment used only for people who have AAT-related lung diseases. This therapy involves getting infusions of the AAT protein. The infusions raise the level of the protein in your blood and lungs.
                
Not enough research has been done to show how well this therapy works. However, some research suggests that this therapy may slow the development of AAT deficiency in people who don't have severe disease.
                
People who have AAT deficiency and develop related liver or skin diseases will be referred to doctors who treat those diseases.
                
Future Treatments
                
Researchers are working on possible treatments that will target the faulty AAT genes and replace them with healthy genes. These treatments are in the early stages of development.
                
Researchers also are studying therapies that will help misshapen AAT proteins move from the liver into the bloodstream. They're also studying a type of augmentation therapy in which the AAT protein is inhaled instead of injected into a vein.
                
If you're interested in new treatments, ask your doctor about ongoing clinical trials for AAT deficiency.",treatment,Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency,What are the treatments for Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/aat,"You can't prevent alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency because the condition is inherited (passed from parents to children through genes).
                
If you inherit two faulty AAT genes, you'll have AAT deficiency. Even so, you may never develop one of the diseases related to the condition.
                
You can take steps to prevent or delay lung diseases related to AAT deficiency. One important step is to quit smoking. If you don't smoke, don't start.
                
Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. If you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking.
                
For more information about how to quit smoking, go to the Health Topics Smoking and Your Heart article and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's ""Your Guide to a Healthy Heart."" Although these resources focus on heart health, they include basic information about how to quit smoking.
                
Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke and places with dust, fumes, or other toxic substances that you may inhale.
                
Check your living and working spaces for things that may irritate your lungs. Examples include flower and tree pollen, ash, allergens, air pollution, wood burning stoves, paint fumes, and fumes from cleaning products and other household items.
                
If you have a lung disease related to AAT deficiency, ask your doctor whether you might benefit from augmentation therapy. This is a treatment in which you receive infusions of AAT protein.

NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/aplastic,"Treatments for aplastic anemia include blood transfusions, blood and marrow stem cell transplants, and medicines. These treatments can prevent or limit complications, relieve symptoms, and improve quality of life.
                
Blood and marrow stem cell transplants may cure the disorder in some people who are eligible for a transplant. Removing a known cause of aplastic anemia, such as exposure to a toxin, also may cure the condition.
                
Who Needs Treatment
                
People who have mild or moderate aplastic anemia may not need treatment as long as the condition doesn't get worse. People who have severe aplastic anemia need medical treatment right away to prevent complications.
                
People who have very severe aplastic anemia need emergency medical care in a hospital. Very severe aplastic anemia can be fatal if it's not treated right away.
                
Blood Transfusions
                
Blood transfusions can help keep blood cell counts at acceptable levels. A blood transfusion is a common procedure in which blood is given to you through an intravenous (IV) line in one of your blood vessels.
                
Transfusions require careful matching of donated blood with the recipient's blood.
                
Blood transfusions help relieve the symptoms of aplastic anemia, but they're not a permanent treatment.
                
Blood and Marrow Stem Cell Transplants
                
A blood and marrow stem cell transplant replaces damaged stem cells with healthy ones from another person (a donor).
                
During the transplant, which is like a blood transfusion, you get donated stem cells through a tube placed in a vein in your chest. Once the stem cells are in your body, they travel to your bone marrow and begin making new blood cells.
                
Blood and marrow stem cell transplants may cure aplastic anemia in people who can have this type of treatment. The transplant works best in children and young adults with severe aplastic anemia who are in good health and who have matched donors.
                
Older people may be less able to handle the treatments needed to prepare the body for the transplant. They're also more likely to have complications after the transplant.
                
If you have aplastic anemia, talk with your doctor about whether a blood and marrow stem cell transplant is an option for you.
                
Medicines
                
If you have aplastic anemia, your doctor may prescribe medicines to:
                
Stimulate your bone marrow
                
Suppress your immune system
                
Prevent and treat infections
                
Medicines To Stimulate Bone Marrow
                
Man-made versions of substances that occur naturally in the body can stimulate the bone marrow to make more blood cells. Examples of these types of medicines include erythropoietin and colony-stimulating factors.
                
These medicines have some risks. You and your doctor will work together to decide whether the benefits of these medicines outweigh the risks. If this treatment works well, it can help you avoid the need for blood transfusions.
                
Medicines To Suppress the Immune System
                
Research suggests that aplastic anemia may sometimes occur because the body's immune system attacks its own cells by mistake. For this reason, your doctor may prescribe medicines to suppress your immune system.
                
These medicines allow your bone marrow to start making blood cells again. They also may help you avoid the need for blood transfusions.
                
Medicines that suppress the immune system don't cure aplastic anemia. However, they can relieve its symptoms and reduce complications. These medicines often are used for people who can't have blood and marrow stem cell transplants or who are waiting for transplants.
                
Three medicinesoften given togethercan suppress the body's immune system. They are antithymocyte globulin (ATG), cyclosporine, and methylprednisolone.
                
It may take a few months to notice the effects of these medicines. Most often, as blood cell counts rise, symptoms lessen. Blood cell counts in people who respond well to these medicines usually don't reach normal levels. However, the blood cell counts often are high enough to allow people to do their normal activities.
                
People who have aplastic anemia may need long-term treatment with these medicines.
                
Medicines that suppress the immune system can have side effects. They also may increase the risk of developing leukemia (lu-KE-me-ah) or myelodysplasia (MI-e-lo-dis-PLA-ze-ah; MDS). Leukemia is a cancer of the blood cells. MDS is a condition in which the bone marrow makes too many faulty blood cells.
                
Medicines To Prevent and Treat Infections
                
If you have aplastic anemia, you might be at risk for infections due to low white blood cell counts. Your doctor may prescribe antibiotic and antiviral medicines to prevent and treat infections.",treatment,Aplastic Anemia,What are the treatments for Aplastic Anemia ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/topics/ida,"Treatment for iron-deficiency anemia will depend on its cause and severity. Treatments may include dietary changes and supplements, medicines, and surgery.
                
Severe iron-deficiency anemia may require a blood transfusion, iron injections, or intravenous (IV) iron therapy. Treatment may need to be done in a hospital.
                
The goals of treating iron-deficiency anemia are to treat its underlying cause and restore normal levels of red blood cells, hemoglobin, and iron.
                
Dietary Changes and Supplements
                
Iron
                
You may need iron supplements to build up your iron levels as quickly as possible. Iron supplements can correct low iron levels within months. Supplements come in pill form or in drops for children.
                
Large amounts of iron can be harmful, so take iron supplements only as your doctor prescribes. Keep iron supplements out of reach from children. This will prevent them from taking an overdose of iron.
                
Iron supplements can cause side effects, such as dark stools, stomach irritation, and heartburn. Iron also can cause constipation, so your doctor may suggest that you use a stool softener.
                
Your doctor may advise you to eat more foods that are rich in iron. The best source of iron is red meat, especially beef and liver. Chicken, turkey, pork, fish, and shellfish also are good sources of iron.
                
The body tends to absorb iron from meat better than iron from nonmeat foods. However, some nonmeat foods also can help you raise your iron levels. Examples of nonmeat foods that are good sources of iron include:
                
Iron-fortified breads and cereals
                
Peas; lentils; white, red, and baked beans; soybeans; and chickpeas
                
Tofu
                
Dried fruits, such as prunes, raisins, and apricots
                
Spinach and other dark green leafy vegetables
                
Prune juice
                
The Nutrition Facts labels on packaged foods will show how much iron the items contain. The amount is given as a percentage of the total amount of iron you need every day.
                
Vitamin C
                
Vitamin C helps the body absorb iron. Good sources of vitamin C are vegetables and fruits, especially citrus fruits. Citrus fruits include oranges, grapefruits, tangerines, and similar fruits. Fresh and frozen fruits, vegetables, and juices usually have more vitamin C than canned ones.
                
If you're taking medicines, ask your doctor or pharmacist whether you can eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice. Grapefruit can affect the strength of a few medicines and how well they work.
                
Other fruits rich in vitamin C include kiwi fruit, strawberries, and cantaloupes.
                
Vegetables rich in vitamin C include broccoli, peppers, Brussels sprouts, tomatoes, cabbage, potatoes, and leafy green vegetables like turnip greens and spinach.
                
Treatment To Stop Bleeding
                
If blood loss is causing iron-deficiency anemia, treatment will depend on the cause of the bleeding. For example, if you have a bleeding ulcer, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics and other medicines to treat the ulcer.
                
If a polyp or cancerous tumor in your intestine is causing bleeding, you may need surgery to remove the growth.
                
If you have heavy menstrual flow, your doctor may prescribe birth control pills to help reduce your monthly blood flow. In some cases, surgery may be advised.
                
Treatments for Severe Iron-Deficiency Anemia
                
Blood Transfusion
                
If your iron-deficiency anemia is severe, you may get a transfusion of red blood cells. A blood transfusion is a safe, common procedure in which blood is given to you through an IV line in one of your blood vessels. A transfusion requires careful matching of donated blood with the recipient's blood.
                
A transfusion of red blood cells will treat your anemia right away. The red blood cells also give a source of iron that your body can reuse. However, a blood transfusion is only a short-term treatment. Your doctor will need to find and treat the cause of your anemia.
                
Blood transfusions are usually reserved for people whose anemia puts them at a higher risk for heart problems or other severe health issues.

Iron Therapy
                
If you have severe anemia, your doctor may recommend iron therapy. For this treatment, iron is injected into a muscle or an IV line in one of your blood vessels.
                
IV iron therapy presents some safety concerns. It must be done in a hospital or clinic by experienced staff. Iron therapy usually is given to people who need iron long-term but can't take iron supplements by mouth. This therapy also is given to people who need immediate treatment for iron-deficiency anemia.",treatment,Iron-Deficiency Anemia,What are the treatments for Iron-Deficiency Anemia ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/topics/ida,"Eating a well-balanced diet that includes iron-rich foods may help you prevent iron-deficiency anemia.
                
Taking iron supplements also may lower your risk for the condition if you're not able to get enough iron from food. Large amounts of iron can be harmful, so take iron supplements only as your doctor prescribes.
                
For more information about diet and supplements, go to ""How Is Iron-Deficiency Anemia Treated?""
                
Infants and young children and women are the two groups at highest risk for iron-deficiency anemia. Special measures can help prevent the condition in these groups.
                
Infants and Young Children
                
A baby's diet can affect his or her risk for iron-deficiency anemia. For example, cow's milk is low in iron. For this and other reasons, cow's milk isn't recommended for babies in their first year. After the first year, you may need to limit the amount of cow's milk your baby drinks.
                
Also, babies need more iron as they grow and begin to eat solid foods. Talk with your child's doctor about a healthy diet and food choices that will help your child get enough iron.
                
Your child's doctor may recommend iron drops. However, giving a child too much iron can be harmful. Follow the doctor's instructions and keep iron supplements and vitamins away from children. Asking for child-proof packages for supplements can help prevent overdosing in children.
                
Because recent research supports concerns that iron deficiency during infancy and childhood can have long-lasting, negative effects on brain health, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends testing all infants for anemia at 1 year of age.
                
Women and Girls
                
Women of childbearing age may be tested for iron-deficiency anemia, especially if they have:
                
A history of iron-deficiency anemia
                
Heavy blood loss during their monthly periods
                
Other risk factors for iron-deficiency anemia
                
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has developed guidelines for who should be screened for iron deficiency, and how often:
                
Girls aged 12 to 18 and women of childbearing age who are not pregnant: Every 5 to 10 years.
                
Women who have risk factors for iron deficiency: Once a year.
                
Pregnant women: At the first prenatal visit.
                
For pregnant women, medical care during pregnancy usually includes screening for anemia. Also, your doctor may prescribe iron supplements or advise you to eat more iron-rich foods.This not only will help you avoid iron-deficiency anemia, but also may lower your risk of having a low-birth-weight baby.",prevention,Iron-Deficiency Anemia,How to prevent Iron-Deficiency Anemia ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/poly,"Polycythemia vera (PV) doesn't have a cure. However, treatments can help control the disease and its complications. PV is treated with procedures, medicines, and other methods. You may need one or more treatments to manage the disease.
                
Goals of Treatment
                
The goals of treating PV are to control symptoms and reduce the risk of complications, especially heart attack and stroke. To do this, PV treatments reduce the number of red blood cells and the level of hemoglobin (an iron-rich protein) in the blood. This brings the thickness of your blood closer to normal.
                
Blood with normal thickness flows better through the blood vessels. This reduces the chance that blood clots will form and cause a heart attack or stroke.
                
Blood with normal thickness also ensures that your body gets enough oxygen. This can help reduce some of the signs and symptoms of PV, such as headaches, vision problems, and itching.
                
Studies show that treating PV greatly improves your chances of living longer.
                
The goal of treating secondary polycythemia is to control its underlying cause, if possible. For example, if the cause is carbon monoxide exposure, the goal is to find the source of the carbon monoxide and fix or remove it.
                
Treatments To Lower Red Blood Cell Levels
                
Phlebotomy
                
Phlebotomy (fle-BOT-o-me) is a procedure that removes some blood from your body. For this procedure, a needle is inserted into one of your veins. Blood from the vein flows through an airtight tube into a sterile container or bag. The process is similar to the process of donating blood.
                
Phlebotomy reduces your red blood cell count and starts to bring your blood thickness closer to normal.
                
Typically, a pint (1 unit) of blood is removed each week until your hematocrit level approaches normal. (Hematocrit is the measure of how much space red blood cells take up in your blood.)
                
You may need to have phlebotomy done every few months.
                
Medicines
                
Your doctor may prescribe medicines to keep your bone marrow from making too many red blood cells. Examples of these medicines include hydroxyurea and interferon-alpha.
                
Hydroxyurea is a medicine generally used to treat cancer. This medicine can reduce the number of red blood cells and platelets in your blood. As a result, this medicine helps improve your blood flow and bring the thickness of your blood closer to normal.
                
Interferon-alpha is a substance that your body normally makes. It also can be used to treat PV. Interferon-alpha can prompt your immune system to fight overactive bone marrow cells. This helps lower your red blood cell count and keep your blood flow and blood thickness closer to normal.
                
Radiation Treatment
                
Radiation treatment can help suppress overactive bone marrow cells. This helps lower your red blood cell count and keep your blood flow and blood thickness closer to normal.
                
However, radiation treatment can raise your risk of leukemia (blood cancer) and other blood diseases.
                
Treatments for Symptoms
                
Aspirin can relieve bone pain and burning feelings in your hands or feet that you may have as a result of PV. Aspirin also thins your blood, so it reduces the risk of blood clots.
                
Aspirin can have side effects, including bleeding in the stomach and intestines. For this reason, take aspirin only as your doctor recommends.
                
If your PV causes itching, your doctor may prescribe medicines to ease the discomfort. Your doctor also may prescribe ultraviolet light treatment to help relieve your itching.
                
Other ways to reduce itching include:
                
Avoiding hot baths. Cooler water can limit irritation to your skin.
                
Gently patting yourself dry after bathing. Vigorous rubbing with a towel can irritate your skin.
                
Taking starch baths. Add half a box of starch to a tub of lukewarm water. This can help soothe your skin.
                
Experimental Treatments
                
Researchers are studying other treatments for PV. An experimental treatment for itching involves taking low doses of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). This type of medicine is used to treat depression. In clinical trials, SSRIs reduced itching in people who had PV.
                
Imatinib mesylate is a medicine that's approved for treating leukemia. In clinical trials, this medicine helped reduce the need for phlebotomy in people who had PV. This medicine also helped reduce the size of enlarged spleens.
                
Researchers also are trying to find a treatment that can block or limit the effects of an abnormal JAK2 gene. (A mutation, or change, in the JAK2 gene is the major cause of PV.)",treatment,Polycythemia Vera,What are the treatments for Polycythemia Vera ?,Drugs

NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/rds,"Treatment for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) usually begins as soon as an infant is born, sometimes in the delivery room.
                
Most infants who show signs of RDS are quickly moved to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). There they receive around-the-clock treatment from health care professionals who specialize in treating premature infants.
                
The most important treatments for RDS are:
                
Surfactant replacement therapy.
                
Breathing support from a ventilator or nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) machine. These machines help premature infants breathe better.
                
Oxygen therapy.
                
Surfactant Replacement Therapy
                
Surfactant is a liquid that coats the inside of the lungs. It helps keep them open so that an infant can breathe in air once he or she is born.
                
Babies who have RDS are given surfactant until their lungs are able to start making the substance on their own. Surfactant usually is given through a breathing tube. The tube allows the surfactant to go directly into the baby's lungs.
                
Once the surfactant is given, the breathing tube is connected to a ventilator, or the baby may get breathing support from NCPAP.
                
Surfactant often is given right after birth in the delivery room to try to prevent or treat RDS. It also may be given several times in the days that follow, until the baby is able to breathe better.
                
Some women are given medicines called corticosteroids during pregnancy. These medicines can speed up surfactant production and lung development in a fetus. Even if you had these medicines, your infant may still need surfactant replacement therapy after birth.
                
Breathing Support
                
Infants who have RDS often need breathing support until their lungs start making enough surfactant. Until recently, a mechanical ventilator usually was used. The ventilator was connected to a breathing tube that ran through the infant's mouth or nose into the windpipe.
                
Today, more and more infants are receiving breathing support from NCPAP. NCPAP gently pushes air into the baby's lungs through prongs placed in the infant's nostrils.
                
Oxygen Therapy
                
Infants who have breathing problems may get oxygen therapy. Oxygen is given through a ventilator or NCPAP machine, or through a tube in the nose. This treatment ensures that the infants' organs get enough oxygen to work well.
                
For more information, go to the Health Topics Oxygen Therapy article.
                
Other Treatments
                
Other treatments for RDS include medicines, supportive therapy, and treatment for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). PDA is a condition that affects some premature infants.
                
Medicines
                
Doctors often give antibiotics to infants who have RDS to control infections (if the doctors suspect that an infant has an infection).
                
Supportive Therapy
                
Treatment in the NICU helps limit stress on babies and meet their basic needs of warmth, nutrition, and protection. Such treatment may include:
                
Using a radiant warmer or incubator to keep infants warm and reduce the risk of infection.
                
Ongoing monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, breathing, and temperature through sensors taped to the babies' bodies.
                
Using sensors on fingers or toes to check the amount of oxygen in the infants' blood.
                
Giving fluids and nutrients through needles or tubes inserted into the infants' veins. This helps prevent malnutrition and promotes growth. Nutrition is critical to the growth and development of the lungs. Later, babies may be given breast milk or infant formula through feeding tubes that are passed through their noses or mouths and into their throats.
                
Checking fluid intake to make sure that fluid doesn't build up in the babies' lungs.
                
Treatment for Patent Ductus Arteriosus
                
PDA is a possible complication of RDS. In this condition, a fetal blood vessel called the ductus arteriosus doesn't close after birth as it should.
                
The ductus arteriosus connects a lung artery to a heart artery. If it remains open, it can strain the heart and increase blood pressure in the lung arteries.
                
PDA is treated with medicines, catheter procedures, and surgery. For more information, go to the Health Topics Patent Ductus Arteriosus article.",treatment,Respiratory Distress Syndrome,What are the treatments for Respiratory Distress Syndrome ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/rds,"Taking steps to ensure a healthy pregnancy might prevent your infant from being born before his or her lungs have fully developed. These steps include:
                
Seeing your doctor regularly during your pregnancy
                
Following a healthy diet
                
Avoiding tobacco smoke, alcohol, and illegal drugs
                
Managing any medical conditions you have
                
Preventing infections
                
If you're having a planned cesarean delivery (C-section), your doctor can do tests before delivery to show whether it's likely that your baby's lungs are fully developed. These tests assess the age of the fetus or lung maturity.
                
Your doctor may give you injections of a corticosteroid medicine if he or she thinks you may give birth too early. This medicine can speed up surfactant production and development of the lungs, brain, and kidneys in your baby.
                
Treatment with corticosteroids can reduce your baby's risk of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). If the baby does develop RDS, it will probably be fairly mild.

NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/pda,"Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is treated with medicines, catheter-based procedures, and surgery. The goal of treatment is to close the PDA. Closure will help prevent complications and reverse the effects of increased blood volume.
                
Small PDAs often close without treatment. For full-term infants, treatment is needed if the PDA is large or causing health problems. For premature infants, treatment is needed if the PDA is causing breathing problems or heart problems.
                
Talk with your child's doctor about treatment options and how your family prefers to handle treatment decisions.
                
Medicines
                
Your child's doctor may prescribe medicines to help close your child's PDA.
                
Indomethacin (in-doh-METH-ah-sin) is a medicine that helps close PDAs in premature infants. This medicine triggers the PDA to constrict or tighten, which closes the opening. Indomethacin usually doesn't work in full-term infants.
                
Ibuprofen also is used to close PDAs in premature infants. This medicine is similar to indomethacin.
                
Catheter-Based Procedures
                
Catheters are thin, flexible tubes that doctors use as part of a procedure called cardiac catheterization (KATH-eh-ter-ih-ZA-shun). Catheter-based procedures often are used to close PDAs in infants or children who are large enough to have the procedure.
                
Your child's doctor may refer to the procedure as ""transcatheter device closure."" The procedure sometimes is used for small PDAs to prevent the risk of infective endocarditis (IE). IE is an infection of the inner lining of the heart chambers and valves.
                
Your child will be given medicine to help him or her relax or sleep during the procedure. The doctor will insert a catheter in a large blood vessel in the groin (upper thigh). He or she will then guide the catheter to your child's heart.
                
A small metal coil or other blocking device is passed through the catheter and placed in the PDA. This device blocks blood flow through the vessel.
                
Catheter-based procedures don't require the child's chest to be opened. They also allow the child to recover quickly.
                
These procedures often are done on an outpatient basis. You'll most likely be able to take your child home the same day the procedure is done.
                
Complications from catheter-based procedures are rare and short term. They can include bleeding, infection, and movement of the blocking device from where it was placed.
                
Surgery
                
Surgery to correct a PDA may be done if:
                
A premature or full-term infant has health problems due to a PDA and is too small to have a catheter-based procedure
                
A catheter-based procedure doesn't successfully close the PDA
                
Surgery is planned for treatment of related congenital heart defects
                
Often, surgery isn't done until after 6 months of age in infants who don't have health problems from their PDAs. Doctors sometimes do surgery on small PDAs to prevent the risk of IE.
                
For the surgery, your child will be given medicine so that he or she will sleep and not feel any pain. The surgeon will make a small incision (cut) between your child's ribs to reach the PDA. He or she will close the PDA using stitches or clips.
                
Complications from surgery are rare and usually short term. They can include hoarseness, a paralyzed diaphragm (the muscle below the lungs), infection, bleeding, or fluid buildup around the lungs.
                
After Surgery
                
After surgery, your child will spend a few days in the hospital. He or she will be given medicine to reduce pain and anxiety. Most children go home 2 days after surgery. Premature infants usually have to stay in the hospital longer because of their other health issues.
                
The doctors and nurses at the hospital will teach you how to care for your child at home. They will talk to you about:
                
Limits on activity for your child while he or she recovers
                
Followup appointments with your child's doctors
                
How to give your child medicines at home, if needed
                
When your child goes home after surgery, you can expect that he or she will feel fairly comfortable. However, you child may have some short-term pain.
                
Your child should begin to eat better and gain weight quickly. Within a few weeks, he or she should fully recover and be able to take part in normal activities.
                
Long-term complications from surgery are rare. However, they can include narrowing of the aorta, incomplete closure of the PDA, and reopening of the PDA.",treatment,Patent Ductus Arteriosus,What are the treatments for Patent Ductus Arteriosus ?,Drugs

Not all medicines and lifestyle changes work for everyone. It may take weeks to months for you and your doctor to find the best treatment.
                
Medicines
                
You may need one or more medicines to treat narcolepsy symptoms. These may include:
                
Stimulants to ease daytime sleepiness and raise your alertness.
                
A medicine that helps make up for the low levels of hypocretin in your brain. (Hypocretin is a chemical that helps promote wakefulness.) This medicine helps you stay awake during the day and sleep at night. It doesn't always completely relieve daytime sleepiness, so your doctor may tell you to take it with a stimulant.
                
Medicines that help you sleep at night.
                
Medicines used to treat depression. These medicines also help prevent cataplexy, hallucinations, and sleep paralysis.
                
Some prescription and over-the-counter medicines can interfere with your sleep. Ask your doctor about these medicines and how to avoid them, if possible. For example, your doctor may advise you to avoid antihistamines. These medicines suppress the action of histamine, a substance in the blood that promotes wakefulness.
                
If you take regular naps when you feel sleepy, you may need less medicine to stay awake.
                
Lifestyle Changes
                
Lifestyle changes also may help relieve some narcolepsy symptoms. You can take steps to make it easier to fall asleep at night and stay asleep.
                
Follow a regular sleep schedule. Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day.
                
Do something relaxing before bedtime, such as taking a warm bath.
                
Keep your bedroom or sleep area quiet, comfortable, dark, and free from distractions, such as a TV or computer.
                
Allow yourself about 20 minutes to fall asleep or fall back asleep after waking up. After that, get up and do something relaxing (like reading) until you get sleepy.
                
Certain activities, foods, and drinks before bedtime can keep you awake. Try to follow these guidelines:
                
Exercise regularly, but not within 3 hours of bedtime.
                
Avoid tobacco, alcohol, chocolate, and drinks that contain caffeine for several hours before bedtime.
                
Avoid large meals and beverages just before bedtime.
                
Avoid bright lights before bedtime.

NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/smo,"The chemicals in tobacco smoke harm your heart and blood vessels in many ways. For example, they:
                
Contribute to inflammation, which may trigger plaque buildup in your arteries.
                
Damage blood vessel walls, making them stiff and less elastic (stretchy). This damage narrows the blood vessels and contributes to the damage caused by unhealthy cholesterol levels.
                
Disturb normal heart rhythms.
                
Increase your blood pressure and heart rate, making your heart work harder thannormal.
                
Lower your HDL (good) cholesterol and raise your LDL (bad) cholesterol. Smoking also increases your triglyceride level. Triglycerides are a type of fat found in theblood.
                
Thicken your blood and make it harder for your blood to carry oxygen.
                
Smoking and Heart Disease Risk
                
Smoking is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease, a condition in which plaque builds up inside the coronary arteries. These arteries supply your heart muscle with oxygen-rich blood.
                
When plaque builds up in the arteries, the condition is called atherosclerosis.
                
Plaque narrows the arteries and reduces blood flow to your heart muscle. The buildup of plaque also makes it more likely that blood clots will form in your arteries. Blood clots can partially or completely block blood flow.
                
Over time, smoking contributes to atherosclerosis and increases your risk of having and dying from heart disease, heart failure, or a heartattack.
                
Compared with nonsmokers, people who smoke are more likely to have heart disease and suffer from a heart attack. The risk of having or dying from a heart attack is even higher among people who smoke and already have heart disease.
                
For some people, such as women who use birth control pills and people who have diabetes, smoking poses an even greater risk to the heart and blood vessels.
                
Smoking is a major risk factor for heart disease. When combined with other risk factorssuch as unhealthy blood cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, and overweight or obesitysmoking further raises the risk of heart disease.
                
Smoking and the Risk of Peripheral Artery Disease
                
Peripheral artery disease (P.A.D.) is a disease in which plaque builds up in the arteries that carry blood to your head, organs, and limbs. Smoking is a major risk factor for P.A.D.
                
P.A.D. usually affects the arteries that carry blood to your legs. Blocked blood flow in the leg arteries can cause cramping, pain, weakness, and numbness in your hips, thighs, and calf muscles.
                
Blocked blood flow also can raise your risk of getting an infection in the affected limb. Your body might have a hard time fighting the infection.
                
If severe enough, blocked blood flow can cause gangrene (tissue death). In very serious cases, this can lead to leg amputation.
                
If you have P.A.D., your risk of heart disease and heart attack is higher than the risk for people who dont have P.A.D.
                
Smoking even one or two cigarettes a day can interfere with P.A.D. treatments. People who smoke and people who have diabetes are at highest risk for P.A.D. complications, including gangrene in the leg from decreased blood flow.
                
Secondhand Smoke Risks
                
Secondhand smoke is the smoke that comes from the burning end of a cigarette, cigar, or pipe. Secondhand smoke also refers to smoke thats breathed out by a person who is smoking.
                
Secondhand smoke contains many of the same harmful chemicals that people inhale when they smoke. It can damage the heart and blood vessels of people who dont smoke in the same way that active smoking harms people who do smoke. Secondhand smoke greatly increases adults risk of heart attack and death.
                
Secondhand smoke also raises the risk of future coronary heart disease in children and teens because it:
                
Damages heart tissues
                
Lowers HDL cholesterol
                
Raises blood pressure
                
The risks of secondhand smoke are especially high for premature babies who have respiratory distress syndrome and children who have conditions such asasthma.
                
Cigar and Pipe Smoke Risks
                
Researchers know less about how cigar and pipe smoke affects the heart and blood vessels than they do about cigarette smoke.
                
However, the smoke from cigars and pipes contains the same harmful chemicals as the smoke from cigarettes. Also, studies have shown that people who smoke cigars are at increased risk of heart disease.",susceptibility,Smoking and Your Heart,Who is at risk for Smoking and Your Heart? ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/arr,"Common arrhythmia treatments include medicines, medical procedures, and surgery. Your doctor may recommend treatment if your arrhythmia causes serious symptoms, such as dizziness, chest pain, or fainting.
                
Your doctor also may recommend treatment if the arrhythmia increases your risk for problems such as heart failure, stroke, or sudden cardiac arrest.
                
Medicines
                
Medicines can slow down a heart that's beating too fast. They also can change an abnormal heart rhythm to a normal, steady rhythm. Medicines that do this are called antiarrhythmics.
                
Some of the medicines used to slow a fast heart rate are beta blockers (such as metoprolol and atenolol), calcium channel blockers (such as diltiazem and verapamil), and digoxin (digitalis). These medicines often are used to treat atrial fibrillation (AF).
                
Some of the medicines used to restore a normal heart rhythm are amiodarone, sotalol, flecainide, propafenone, dofetilide, ibutilide, quinidine, procainamide, and disopyramide. These medicines often have side effects. Some side effects can make an arrhythmia worse or even cause a different kind of arrhythmia.
                
Currently, no medicine can reliably speed up a slow heart rate. Abnormally slow heart rates are treated with pacemakers.
                
People who have AF and some other arrhythmias may be treated with blood-thinning medicines. These medicines reduce the risk of blood clots forming. Warfarin (Coumadin), dabigatran, heparin, and aspirin are examples of blood-thinning medicines.
                
Medicines also can control an underlying medical condition that might be causing an arrhythmia, such as heart disease or a thyroid condition.
                
Medical Procedures
                
Some arrhythmias are treated with pacemakers. A pacemaker is a small device that's placed under the skin of your chest or abdomen to help control abnormal heart rhythms.
                
Pacemakers have sensors that detect the heart's electrical activity. When the device senses an abnormal heart rhythm, it sends electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate.
                
Some arrhythmias are treated with a jolt of electricity to the heart. This type of treatment is called cardioversion or defibrillation, depending on which type of arrhythmia is being treated.
                
Some people who are at risk for ventricular fibrillation are treated with a device called an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). Like a pacemaker, an ICD is a small device that's placed under the skin in the chest. This device uses electrical pulses or shocks to help control life-threatening arrhythmias.
                
An ICD continuously monitors the heartbeat. If it senses a dangerous ventricular arrhythmia, it sends an electric shock to the heart to restore a normal heartbeat.
                
A procedure called catheter ablation is used to treat some arrhythmias if medicines don't work. During this procedure, a thin, flexible tube is put into a blood vessel in your arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck. Then, the tube is guided to your heart.
                
A special machine sends energy through the tube to your heart. The energy finds and destroys small areas of heart tissue where abnormal heart rhythms may start. Catheter ablation usually is done in a hospital as part of an electrophysiology study.
                
Your doctor may recommend transesophageal echocardiography before catheter ablation to make sure no blood clots are present in the atria (the heart's upper chambers).
                
Surgery
                
Doctors treat some arrhythmias with surgery. This may occur if surgery is already being done for another reason, such as repair of a heart valve.
                
One type of surgery for AF is called maze surgery. During this surgery, a surgeon makes small cuts or burns in the atria. These cuts or burns prevent the spread of disorganized electrical signals.
                
If coronary heart disease is the cause of your arrhythmia, your doctor may recommend coronary artery bypass grafting. This surgery improves blood flow to the heart muscle.
                
Other Treatments
                
Vagal maneuvers are another type of treatment for arrhythmia. These simple exercises sometimes can stop or slow down certain types of supraventricular arrhythmias. They do this by affecting the vagus nerve, which helps control the heart rate.
                
Some vagal maneuvers include:
                
Gagging
                
Holding your breath and bearing down (Valsalva maneuver)
                
Immersing your face in ice-cold water
                
Coughing
                
Putting your fingers on your eyelids and pressing down gently
                
Vagal maneuvers aren't an appropriate treatment for everyone. Discuss with your doctor whether vagal maneuvers are an option for you.",treatment,Arrhythmia,What are the treatments for Arrhythmia ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/hd,"You can prevent and control many coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors with heart-healthy lifestyle changes and medicines. Examples of risk factors you can control include high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, and overweight and obesity. Only a few risk factorssuch as age, gender, and family historycant be controlled.
                
To reduce your risk of CHD and heart attack, try to control each risk factor you can. The good news is that many lifestyle changes help control several CHD risk factors at the same time. For example, physical activity may lower your blood pressure, help control diabetes and prediabetes, reduce stress, and help control your weight.
                
Heart-Healthy Lifestyle Changes
                
A heart-healthy lifestyle can lower the risk of CHD. If you already have CHD, a heart-healthy lifestyle may prevent it from getting worse. Heart-healthy lifestyle changes include:
                
Heart-healthy eating
                
Maintaining a healthy weight
                
Managing stress
                
Physical activity
                
Quitting smoking
                
Many lifestyle habits begin during childhood. Thus, parents and families should encourage their children to make heart-healthy choices, such as following a healthy diet and being physically active. Make following a healthy lifestyle a family goal. Making lifestyle changes can be hard. But if you make these changes as a family, it may be easier for everyone to prevent or control their CHD risk factors.

Heart-Healthy Eating
                
Your doctor may recommend heart-healthy eating, which should include:
                
Fat-free or low-fat dairy products, such as skim milk
                
Fish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and trout, about twice a week
                
Fruits, such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes
                
Legumes, such as kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans
                
Vegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and carrots
                
Whole grains, such as oatmeal, brown rice, and corn tortillas
                
When following a heart-healthy diet, you should avoid eating:
                
A lot of red meat
                
Palm and coconut oils
                
Sugary foods and beverages
                
Two nutrients in your diet make blood cholesterol levels rise:
                
Saturated fatfound mostly in foods that come from animals
                
Trans fat (trans fatty acids)found in foods made with hydrogenated oils and fats, such as stick margarine; baked goods, such as cookies, cakes, and pies; crackers; frostings; and coffee creamers. Some trans fats also occur naturally in animal fats andmeats.
                
Saturated fat raises your blood cholesterol more than anything else in your diet. When you follow a heart-healthy eating plan, only 5 percent to 6 percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. Food labels list the amounts of saturated fat. To help you stay on track, here are some examples:
                
1,200 calories a day
                
8 grams of saturated fat a day
                
1,500 calories a day
                
10 grams of saturated fat a day
                
1,800 calories a day
                
12 grams of saturated fat a day
                
2,000 calories a day
                
13 grams of saturated fat a day
                
2,500 calories a day
                
17 grams of saturated fat a day
                
Not all fats are bad. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats actually help lower blood cholesterol levels.
                
Some sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are:
                
Avocados
                
Corn, sunflower, and soybean oils
                
Nuts and seeds, such as walnuts
                
Olive, canola, peanut, safflower, and sesame oils
                
Peanut butter
                
Salmon and trout
                
Tofu
                
Sodium
                
You should try to limit the amount of sodium that you eat. This means choosing and preparing foods that are lower in salt and sodium. Try to use low-sodium and no added salt foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. Food labels tell you what you need to know about choosing foods that are lower in sodium. Try to eat no more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium a day. If you have high blood pressure, you may need to restrict your sodium intake even more.
                
Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension
                
Your doctor may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan if you have high blood pressure. The DASH eating plan focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and low in fat, cholesterol, and sodium and salt.
                
The DASH eating plan is a good heart-healthy eating plan, even for those who dont have high blood pressure. Read more about DASH.
                
Alcohol
                
Try to limit alcohol intake. Too much alcohol canraise your blood pressure and triglyceride levels, a type of fat found in the blood. Alcohol also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain.
                
Men should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day. Women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day. One drink is:
                
12 ounces of beer
                
5 ounces of wine
                
1 ounces of liquor
                
Maintaining a Healthy Weight
                
Maintaining a healthy weight is important for overall health and can lower your risk for coronary heart disease. Aim for a Healthy Weight by following a heart-healthy eating plan and keeping physically active.
                
Knowing your body mass index (BMI) helps you find out if youre a healthy weight in relation to your height and gives an estimate of your total body fat. To figure out your BMI, check out NHLBIs online BMI calculator or talk to your doctor. A BMI:
                
Below 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight.
                
Between 18.5 and 24.9 is in the normal range.
                
Between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight.
                
Of 30 or more is considered obese.
                
A general goal to aim for is a BMI of less than 25. Your doctor or health care provider can help you set an appropriate BMI goal.
                
Measuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. If most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type 2 diabetes. This risk may be high with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. To learn how to measure your waist, visit Assessing Your Weight and Health Risk.
                
If youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. A loss of just 3 percent to 5 percent of your current weight can lower your triglycerides, blood glucose, and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Greater amounts of weight loss can improve blood pressure readings, lower LDL cholesterol, and increase HDL cholesterol.
                
Managing Stress
                
Research shows that the most commonly reported trigger for a heart attack is an emotionally upsetting eventparticularly one involving anger. Also, some of the ways people cope with stresssuch as drinking, smoking, or overeatingarent healthy.
                
Learning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health. Consider healthy stress-reducing activities, such as:
                
A stress management program.
                
Meditation
                
Physical activity
                
Relaxation therapy
                
Talking things out with friends or family
                
Physical Activity
                
Routine physical activity can lower many CHD risk factors, including LDL (bad) cholesterol, high blood pressure, and excess weight. Physical activity also can lower your risk for diabetes and raise your HDL cholesterol level. HDL is the good cholesterol that helps prevent CHD.
                
Everyone should try to participate in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2hours and 30minutes per week, or vigorous aerobic exercise for 1 hour and 15 minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats faster and you use more oxygen than usual. The more active you are, the more you will benefit. Participate in aerobic exercise for at least 10 minutes at a time spread throughout the week.

Talk with your doctor before you start a new exercise plan. Ask your doctor how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you.
                
Quitting Smoking
                
If you smoke, quit. Smoking can raise your risk for coronary heart disease and heart attack and worsen other coronary heart disease risk factors. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke. If you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking.

Medicines
                
Sometimes lifestyle changes arent enough to control your blood cholesterol levels. For example, you may need statin medications to control or lower your cholesterol. By lowering your cholesterol level, you can decrease your chance of having a heart attack or stroke. Doctors usually prescribe statins for people who have:
                
Coronary heart disease, peripheral artery disease, or had a prior stroke
                
Diabetes
                
High LDL cholesterol levels
                
Doctors may discuss beginning statin treatment with those who have an elevated risk for developing heart disease or having a stroke.
                
Your doctor also may prescribe other medications to:
                
Decrease your chance of having a heart attack or dying suddenly.
                
Lower your blood pressure.
                
Prevent blood clots, which can lead to heart attack or stroke.
                
Prevent or delay the need for a procedure or surgery, such as percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting. 
                
Reduce your hearts workload and relieve CHD.
                
Take all medicines regularly, as your doctor prescribes. Dont change the amount of your medicine or skip a dose unless your doctor tells you to.You should still follow a heart-healthy lifestyle, even if you take medicines to treat your CHD.",prevention,Coronary Heart Disease Risk Factors,How to prevent Coronary Heart Disease Risk Factors ?,Drugs

Below 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight.
                
Between 18.5 and 24.9 is in the normal range.
                
Between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight.
                
Of 30 or more is considered obese.
                
A general goal to aim for is a BMI of less than 25. Your doctor or health care provider can help you set an appropriate BMI goal.
                
Measuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. If most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type 2 diabetes. This risk may be high with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. To learn how to measure your waist, visitAssessing Your Weight and Health Risk.
                
If youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. A loss of just 3 percent to 5 percent of your current weight can lower your triglycerides, blood glucose, and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Greater amounts of weight loss can improve blood pressure readings, lower LDL cholesterol, and increase HDL cholesterol.
                

                
Managing Stress
                
Research shows that the most commonly reported trigger for a heart attack is an emotionally upsetting eventparticularly one involving anger. Also, some of the ways people cope with stresssuch as drinking, smoking, or overeatingarent healthy.
                
Learning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health.Consider healthy stress-reducing activities, such as:
                
A stress management program
                
Meditation
                
Physical activity
                
Relaxation therapy
                
Talking things out with friends or family
                

                
Physical Activity
                
Routine physical activity can lower many risk factors for coronary heart disease, including LDL (bad) cholesterol, high blood pressure, and excess weight. Physical activity also can lower your risk for diabetes and raise your HDL cholesterol level. HDL is the good cholesterol that helps prevent coronary heart disease.
                
Everyone should try to participate in moderate intensity aerobic exercise at least 2hours and 30minutes per week, or vigorous intensity aerobic exercise for 1hour and 15minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats fasterand you use more oxygen than usual. The more active you are, the more you will benefit. Participate in aerobic exercise for at least 10 minutes at a time spread throughout the week.

Talk with your doctor before you start a new exercise plan. Ask your doctor how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you.
                

                
Quitting Smoking
                
If you smoke, quit. Smoking can raise your risk for coronary heart disease and heart attack and worsen other coronary heart disease risk factors. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke.
                
If you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking.

Medicines
                
Many medicines are used to treat cardiomyopathy. Your doctor may prescribe medicines to:
                
Balance electrolytes in your body. Electrolytes are minerals that help maintain fluid levels and acid-base balance in the body. They also help muscle and nerve tissues work properly. Abnormal electrolyte levels may be a sign of dehydration (lack of fluid in your body), heart failure, high blood pressure, or other disorders. Aldosterone blockers are an example of a medicine used to balance electrolytes.
                
Keep your heart beating with a normal rhythm. These medicines, called antiarrhythmics, help prevent arrhythmias.
                
Lower your blood pressure. ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers are examples of medicines that lower blood pressure.
                
Prevent blood clots from forming. Anticoagulants, or blood thinners, are an example of a medicine that prevents blood clots. Blood thinners often are used to prevent blood clots from forming in people who have dilated cardiomyopathy.
                
Reduce inflammation. Corticosteroids are an example of a medicine used to reduce inflammation.
                
Remove excess sodium from your body. Diuretics, or water pills, are an example of medicines that help remove excess sodium from the body, which reduces the amount of fluid in your blood.
                
Slow your heart rate. Beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digoxin are examples of medicines that slow the heart rate. Beta blockers and calcium channel blockers also are used to lower blood pressure.
                
Take all medicines regularly, as your doctor prescribes. Dont change the amount of your medicine or skip a dose unless your doctor tells you to.
                
Surgery and Implanted Devices
                
Doctors use several types of surgery to treat cardiomyopathy, including septal myectomy, surgically implanted devices, and heart transplant.
                
Septal Myectomy
                
Septal myectomy is open-heart surgery and is used to treat people who have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and severe symptoms. This surgery generally is used for younger patients and for people whose medicines arent working well.
                
A surgeon removes part of the thickened septum thats bulging into the left ventricle. This improves blood flow through the heart and out to the body. The removed tissue doesnt grow back. If needed, the surgeon also can repair or replace the mitral valve at the same time. Septal myectomy often is successful and allows you to return to a normal life with nosymptoms.
                
Surgically Implanted Devices
                
Surgeons can place several types of devices in the heart to improve function and symptoms, including:
                
Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device. A CRT device coordinates contractions between the hearts left and right ventricles.
                
Implantable cardioverter defibrillator(ICD). An ICD helps control life-threatening arrhythmias that may lead tosudden cardiac arrest. This small device is implanted in the chest or abdomen and connected to the heart with wires. If an ICD senses a dangerous change in heart rhythm, it will send an electric shock to the heart to restore a normal heartbeat.
                
Left ventricular assist device (LVAD). This device helps the heart pump blood to the body. An LVAD can be used as a long-term therapy or as a short-term treatment for people who are waiting for a heart transplant.
                
Pacemaker. This small device is placed under the skin of your chest or abdomen to help control arrhythmias. The device uses electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate.
                
Heart Transplant
                
For this surgery, a surgeon replaces a persons diseased heart with a healthy heart from a deceased donor. A heart transplant is a last resort treatment for people who have end-stage heart failure. End-stage means the condition has become so severe that all treatments, other than heart transplant, have failed. For more information about this treatment, go to the Heart Transplant Health Topic.
                
Nonsurgical Procedure
                
Doctors may use a nonsurgical procedure called alcohol septal ablation to treat cardiomyopathy. During this procedure, the doctor injects ethanol (a type of alcohol) through a tube into the small artery that supplies blood to the thickened area of heart muscle. The alcohol kills cells, and the thickened tissue shrinks to a more normal size. This procedure allows blood to flow freely through the ventricle, which improves symptoms.",treatment,Cardiomyopathy,What are the treatments for Cardiomyopathy ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/cm,"You can't prevent inherited types of cardiomyopathy. However, you can take steps to lower your risk for diseases or conditions that may lead to or complicate cardiomyopathy. Examples includecoronary heart disease,high blood pressure, andheart attack.
                
Your doctor may advise you to make heart-healthy lifestyle changes, such as:
                
Avoiding the use of alcohol and illegal drugs
                
Getting enough sleep and rest
                
Heart-healthy eating
                
Physicalactivity
                
Quitting smoking
                
Managing stress
                
Your cardiomyopathy may be due to an underlying disease or condition. If you treat that condition early enough, you may be able to prevent cardiomyopathy complications. For example, to control high blood pressure,high blood cholesterol, and diabetes:
                
Follow your doctors advice about lifestyle changes.
                
Get regular checkups with your doctor.
                
Take all of your medicines as your doctor prescribes.",prevention,Cardiomyopathy,How to prevent Cardiomyopathy ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/dvt,"Doctors treat deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with medicines and other devices and therapies. The main goals of treating DVT are to:
                
Stop the blood clot from getting bigger
                
Prevent the blood clot from breaking off and moving to your lungs
                
Reduce your chance of having another blood clot
                
Medicines
                
Your doctor may prescribe medicines to prevent or treat DVT.
                
Anticoagulants
                
Anticoagulants (AN-te-ko-AG-u-lants) are the most common medicines for treating DVT. They're also known as blood thinners.
                
These medicines decrease your blood's ability to clot. They also stop existing blood clots from getting bigger. However, blood thinners can't break up blood clots that have already formed. (The body dissolves most blood clots with time.)
                
Blood thinners can be taken as a pill, an injection under the skin, or through a needle or tube inserted into a vein (called intravenous, or IV, injection).
                
Warfarin and heparin are two blood thinners used to treat DVT. Warfarin is given in pill form. (Coumadin is a common brand name for warfarin.) Heparin is given as an injection or through an IV tube. There are different types of heparin. Your doctor will discuss the options with you.
                
Your doctor may treat you with both heparin and warfarin at the same time. Heparin acts quickly. Warfarin takes 2 to 3 days before it starts to work. Once the warfarin starts to work, the heparin is stopped.
                
Pregnant women usually are treated with just heparin because warfarin is dangerous during pregnancy.
                
Treatment for DVT using blood thinners usually lasts for 6 months. The following situations may change the length of treatment:
                
If your blood clot occurred after a short-term risk (for example, surgery), your treatment time may be shorter.
                
If you've had blood clots before, your treatment time may be longer.
                
If you have certain other illnesses, such as cancer, you may need to take blood thinners for as long as you have the illness.
                
The most common side effect of blood thinners is bleeding. Bleeding can happen if the medicine thins your blood too much. This side effect can be life threatening.
                
Sometimes the bleeding is internal (inside your body). People treated with blood thinners usually have regular blood tests to measure their blood's ability to clot. These tests are called PT and PTT tests.
                
These tests also help your doctor make sure you're taking the right amount of medicine. Call your doctor right away if you have easy bruising or bleeding. These may be signs that your medicines have thinned your blood too much.
                
Thrombin Inhibitors
                
These medicines interfere with the blood clotting process. They're used to treat blood clots in patients who can't take heparin.
                
Thrombolytics
                
Doctors prescribe these medicines to quickly dissolve large blood clots that cause severe symptoms. Because thrombolytics can cause sudden bleeding, they're used only in life-threatening situations.
                
Other Types of Treatment
                
Vena Cava Filter
                
If you can't take blood thinners or they're not working well, your doctor may recommend a vena cava filter.
                
The filter is inserted inside a large vein called the vena cava. The filter catches blood clots before they travel to the lungs, which prevents pulmonary embolism. However, the filter doesn't stop new blood clots from forming.
                
Graduated Compression Stockings
                
Graduated compression stockings can reduce leg swelling caused by a blood clot. These stockings are worn on the legs from the arch of the foot to just above or below the knee.
                
Compression stockings are tight at the ankle and become looser as they go up the leg. This creates gentle pressure up the leg. The pressure keeps blood from pooling and clotting.
                
There are three types of compression stockings. One type is support pantyhose, which offer the least amount of pressure.
                
The second type is over-the-counter compression hose. These stockings give a little more pressure than support pantyhose. Over-the-counter compression hose are sold in medical supply stores and pharmacies.
                
Prescription-strength compression hose offer the greatest amount of pressure. They also are sold in medical supply stores and pharmacies. However, a specially trained person needs to fit you for these stockings.
                
Talk with your doctor about how long you should wear compression stockings.",treatment,Deep Vein Thrombosis,What are the treatments for Deep Vein Thrombosis ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/dvt,"You can take steps to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). If you're at risk for these conditions:
                
See your doctor for regular checkups.
                
Take all medicines as your doctor prescribes.
                
Get out of bed and move around as soon as possible after surgery or illness (as your doctor recommends). Moving around lowers your chance of developing a blood clot.
                
Exercise your lower leg muscles during long trips. This helps prevent blood clots from forming.
                
If you've had DVT or PE before, you can help prevent future blood clots. Follow the steps above and:
                
Take all medicines that your doctor prescribes to prevent or treat blood clots
                
Follow up with your doctor for tests and treatment

Travel Tips
                
The risk of developing DVT while traveling is low. The risk increases if the travel time is longer than 4 hours or you have other DVT risk factors.
                
During long trips, it may help to:
                
Walk up and down the aisles of the bus, train, or airplane. If traveling by car, stop about every hour and walk around.
                
Move your legs and flex and stretch your feet to improve blood flow in your calves.
                
Wear loose and comfortable clothing.
                
Drink plenty of fluids and avoid alcohol.
                
If you have risk factors for DVT, your doctor may advise you to wear compression stockings while traveling. Or, he or she may suggest that you take a blood-thinning medicine before traveling.",prevention,Deep Vein Thrombosis,How to prevent Deep Vein Thrombosis ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/pah,"Pulmonary hypertension (PH) has no cure. However, treatment may help relieve symptoms and slow the progress of the disease.
                
PH is treated with medicines, procedures, and other therapies. Treatment will depend on what type of PH you have and its severity. (For more information, go to ""Types of Pulmonary Hypertension."")
                
Group 1 Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
                
Group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) includes PH that's inherited, that has no known cause, or that's caused by certain drugs or conditions. Treatments for group 1 PAH include medicines and medical procedures.
                
Medicines
                
Your doctor may prescribe medicines to relax the blood vessels in your lungs and reduce excess cell growth in the blood vessels. As the blood vessels relax, more blood can flow through them.
                
Your doctor may prescribe medicines that are taken by mouth, inhaled, or injected.
                
Examples of medicines for group 1 PAH include:
                
Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, such as sildenafil
                
Prostanoids, such as epoprostenol
                
Endothelin receptor antagonists, such as bosentan and ambrisentan
                
Calcium channel blockers, such as diltiazem
                
Your doctor may prescribe one or more of these medicines. To find out which of these medicines works best, you'll likely have an acute vasoreactivity test. This test shows how the pressure in your pulmonary arteries reacts to certain medicines. The test is done during right heart catheterization.
                
Medical and Surgical Procedures
                
If you have group 1 PAH, your doctor may recommend one or more of the following procedures.
                
Atrial septostomy (sep-TOS-toe-me). For this procedure, a thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your leg and threaded to your heart. The tube is then put through the wall that separates your right and left atria (the upper chambers of your heart). This wall is called the septum.
                
A tiny balloon on the tip of the tube is inflated. This creates an opening between the atria. This procedure relieves the pressure in the right atria and increases blood flow. Atrial septostomy is rarely done in the United States.
                
Lung transplant. A lung transplant is surgery to replace a person's diseased lung with a healthy lung from a deceased donor. This procedure may be used for people who have severe lung disease that's causing PAH.
                
Heartlung transplant. A heartlung transplant is surgery in which both the heart and lung are replaced with healthy organs from a deceased donor.
                
Group 2 Pulmonary Hypertension
                
Conditions that affect the left side of the heart, such as mitral valve disease, can cause group 2 PH. Treating the underlying condition will help treat PH. Treatments may include lifestyle changes, medicines, and surgery.
                
Group 3 Pulmonary Hypertension
                
Lung diseases, such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and interstitial lung disease, can cause group 3 PH. Certain sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea, also can cause group 3 PH.
                
If you have this type of PH, you may need oxygen therapy. This treatment raises the level of oxygen in your blood. You'll likely get the oxygen through soft, plastic prongs that fit into your nose. Oxygen therapy can be done at home or in a hospital.
                
Your doctor also may recommend other treatments if you have an underlying lung disease.
                
Group 4 Pulmonary Hypertension
                
Blood clots in the lungs or blood clotting disorders can cause group 4 PH. If you have this type of PH, your doctor will likely prescribe blood-thinning medicines. These medicines prevent clots from forming or getting larger.
                
Sometimes doctors use surgery to remove scarring in the pulmonary arteries due to old blood clots.
                
Group 5 Pulmonary Hypertension
                
Various diseases and conditions, such as thyroid disease and sarcoidosis, can cause group 5 PH. An object, such as a tumor, pressing on the pulmonary arteries also can cause group 5 PH.
                
Group 5 PH is treated by treating its cause.
                
All Types of Pulmonary Hypertension
                
Several treatments may be used for all types of PH. These treatments include:
                
Diuretics, also called water pills. These medicines help reduce fluid buildup in your body, including swelling in your ankles and feet.
                
Blood-thinning medicines. These medicines help prevent blood clots from forming or getting larger.
                
Digoxin. This medicine helps the heart beat stronger and pump more blood. Digoxin sometimes is used to control the heart rate if abnormal heart rhythms, such as atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, occur.
                
Oxygen therapy. This treatment raises the level of oxygen in your blood.
                
Physical activity. Regular activity may help improve your ability to be active. Talk with your doctor about a physical activity plan that's safe for you.
                
Research is ongoing for better PH treatments. These treatments offer hope for the future.",treatment,Pulmonary Hypertension,What are the treatments for Pulmonary Hypertension ?,Drugs

Heart-Healthy Eating
                
Your doctor may recommend heart-healthy eating, which should include:
                
Fat-free or low-fat dairy products, such as fat-free milk
                
Fish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and trout, about twice a week
                
Fruits, such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes
                
Legumes, such as kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans
                
Vegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and carrots
                
Whole grains, such as oatmeal, brown rice, and corn tortillas
                
When following a heart-healthy diet, you should avoid eating:
                
A lot of red meat
                
Palm and coconut oils
                
Sugary foods and beverages
                
Two nutrients in your diet make blood cholesterol levels rise:
                
Saturated fatfound mostly in foods that come from animals
                
Trans fat (trans fatty acids)found in foods made with hydrogenated oils and fats, such as stick margarine; baked goods, such as cookies, cakes, and pies; crackers; frostings; and coffee creamers. Some trans fats also occur naturally in animal fats andmeats.
                
Saturated fat raises your blood cholesterol more than anything else in your diet. When you follow a heart-healthy eating plan, only 5 percent to 6 percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. Food labels list the amounts of saturated fat. To help you stay on track, here are some examples:
                
1,200 calories a day
                
8 grams of saturated fat a day
                
1,500 calories a day

Not all fats are bad. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats actually help lower blood cholesterol levels.
                
Some sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are:
                
Avocados
                
Corn, sunflower, and soybean oils
                
Nuts and seeds, such as walnuts
                
Olive, canola, peanut, safflower, and sesame oils
                
Peanut butter
                
Salmon and trout
                
Tofu
                
Sodium
                
You should try to limit the amount of sodium that you eat. This means choosing and preparing foods that are lower in salt and sodium. Try to use low-sodium and no added salt foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. Food labels tell you what you need to know about choosing foods that are lower in sodium. Try to eat no more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium a day. If you have high blood pressure, you may need to restrict your sodium intake even more.
                
Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension
                
Your doctor may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan if you have high blood pressure. The DASH eating plan focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and low in fat, cholesterol, and sodium and salt. The DASH eating plan is a good heart-healthy eating plan, even for those who dont have high blood pressure. Read more about DASH.
                
Alcohol
                
Try to limit alcohol intake. Too much alcohol canraise your blood pressure and triglyceride levels, a type of fat found in the blood. Alcohol also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain.
                
Men should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day. Women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day. One drink is:
                
12 ounces of beer
                
5 ounces of wine
                
1 ounces of liquor
                

                
Maintaining a Healthy Weight
                
Maintaining a healthy weight is important for overall health and can lower your risk for coronary heart disease. Aim for a Healthy Weight by following a heart-healthy eating plan and keeping physically active.
                
Knowing your body mass index (BMI) helps you find out if youre a healthy weight in relation to your height and gives an estimate of your total body fat. To figure out your BMI, check out the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes (NHLBI) online BMI calculator or talk to your doctor. A BMI:
                
Below 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight.
                
Between 18.5 and 24.9 is in the normal range.
                
Between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight.
                
Of 30 or more is considered obese.
                
A general goal to aim for is a BMI of less than 25. Your doctor or health care provider can help you set an appropriate BMI goal.
                
Measuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. If most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type 2 diabetes. This risk may be high with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. To learn how to measure your waist, visit Assessing Your Weight and Health Risk.
                
If youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. A loss of just 3 percent to 5 percent of your current weight can lower your triglycerides, blood glucose, and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Greater amounts of weight loss can improve blood pressure readings, lower LDL cholesterol, and increase HDL cholesterol.
                
Managing Stress
                
Research shows that the most commonly reported trigger for a heart attack is an emotionally upsetting eventparticularly one involving anger. Also, some of the ways people cope with stresssuch as drinking, smoking, or overeatingarent healthy.
                
Learning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health. Consider healthy stress-reducing activities, such as:
                
A stress management program
                
Meditation
                
Physical activity
                
Relaxation therapy
                
Talking things out with friends or family
                
Physical Activity
                
Routine physical activity can lower many coronary heart disease risk factors, including LDL (bad) cholesterol, high blood pressure, and excess weight. Physical activity also can lower your risk for diabetes and raise your HDL cholesterol level. HDL is the good cholesterol that helps prevent coronary heart disease.
                
Everyone should try to participate in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2hours and 30minutes per week, or vigorous aerobic exercise for 1hour and 15minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats faster and you use more oxygen than usual. The more active you are, the more you will benefit. Participate in aerobic exercise for at least 10 minutes at a time spread throughout the week.

Talk with your doctor before you start a new exercise plan. Ask your doctor how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you.
                
Quitting Smoking
                
If you smoke, quit. Smoking can raise your risk for coronary heart disease and heart attack and worsen other coronary heart disease risk factors. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke.
                
If you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking. Read more about quitting smoking at Smoking and Your Heart.
                

                
Medicines
                
Sometimes lifestyle changes arent enough to control your blood cholesterol levels. For example, you may need statin medications to control or lower your cholesterol. By lowering your cholesterol level, you can decrease your chance of having a heart attack or stroke. Doctors usually prescribe statins for people who have:
                
Coronary heart disease, peripheral artery disease, or had a stroke
                
Diabetes
                
High LDL cholesterol levels
                
Doctors may discuss beginning statin treatment with those who have an elevated risk for developing heart disease or having a stroke.
                
Your doctor also may prescribe other medications to:
                
Decrease your chance of having a heart attack or dying suddenly.
                
Lower your blood pressure.
                
Prevent blood clots, which can lead to heart attack or stroke.
                
Prevent or delay the need for a stent or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or surgery, such as coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).
                
Reduce your hearts workload and relieve coronary heart disease symptoms.
                
Take all medicines regularly, as your doctor prescribes. Dont change the amount of your medicine or skip a dose unless your doctor tells you to. You should still follow a heart healthy lifestyle, even if you take medicines to treat your coronary heart disease.
                

                
Medical Procedures and Surgery
                
You may need a procedure or surgery to treat coronary heart disease. Both PCIand CABG are used to treat blocked coronary arteries. You and your doctor can discuss which treatment is right for you.
                
Percutaneous Coronary Intervention
                
Percutaneous coronary intervention, commonly known as angioplasty, is a nonsurgical procedure that opens blocked or narrowed coronary arteries. A thin, flexible tube with a balloon or other device on the end is threaded through a blood vessel to the narrowed or blocked coronary artery. Once in place, the balloon is inflated to compress the plaque against the wall of the artery. This restores blood flow through the artery.
                
During the procedure, the doctor may put a small mesh tube called a stent in the artery. The stent helps prevent blockages in the artery in the months or years after angioplasty. Read more about this procedure at PCI.
                
Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting
                
CABG is a type of surgery in which arteries or veins from other areas in your body are used to bypass (that is, go around) your narrowed coronary arteries. CABG can improve blood flow to your heart, relieve chest pain, and possibly prevent a heart attack.
                
Read more about this surgery at CABG.
                
Cardiac Rehabilitation
                
Your doctor may prescribe cardiac rehabilitation (rehab) for angina or after CABG, angioplasty, or a heart attack. Nearly everyone who has coronary heart disease can benefit from cardiac rehab. Cardiac rehab is a medically supervised program that may help improve the health and well-being of people who have heart problems.
                
The cardiac rehab team may include doctors, nurses, exercise specialists, physical and occupational therapists, dietitians or nutritionists, and psychologists or other mental health specialists.
                
Rehab has two parts:
                
Education, counseling, and training. This part of rehab helps you understand your heart condition and find ways to reduce your risk for future heart problems. The rehab team will help you learn how to cope with the stress of adjusting to a new lifestyle and how to deal with your fears about the future.
                
Exercise training. This part helps you learn how to exercise safely, strengthen your muscles, and improve your stamina. Your exercise plan will be based on your personal abilities, needs, and interests.

NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/cad,"You can prevent and control coronary heart disease (CHD)by taking action to control your risk factors with heart-healthy lifestyle changes and medicines. Examples of risk factors you can control include high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, and overweight and obesity. Only a few risk factorssuch as age, gender, and family historycant be controlled.
                
Your risk for CHD increases with the number of risk factors you have. To reduce your risk of CHD and heart attack, try to control each risk factor you have by adopting the following heart-healthy lifestyles:
                
Heart-healthy eating
                
Maintaining a healthy weight
                
Managing stress
                
Physical activity
                
Quitting smoking
                
Know your family history of health problems related to CHD. If you or someone in your family has CHD, be sure to tell your doctor.

NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/heartattack,"Early treatment for a heart attack can prevent or limit damage to the heart muscle. Acting fast, by calling 911 at the first symptoms of a heart attack, can save your life. Medical personnel can begin diagnosis and treatment even before you get to the hospital.
                
Immediate Treatment
                
Certain treatments usually are started right away if a heart attack is suspected, even before the diagnosis is confirmed. These include:
                
Aspirin to prevent further blood clotting
                
Nitroglycerin to reduce your hearts workload and improve blood flow through the coronary arteries
                
Oxygen therapy
                
Treatment for chest pain
                
Once the diagnosis of a heart attack is confirmed or strongly suspected, doctors start treatments promptly to try to restore blood flow through the blood vessels supplying the heart. The two main treatments are clot-busting medicines and percutaneous coronary intervention, also known as coronary angioplasty, a procedure used to open blocked coronary arteries.
                

                
Clot-Busting Medicines
                
Thrombolytic medicines, also called clot busters, are used to dissolve blood clots that are blocking the coronary arteries. To work best, these medicines must be given within several hours of the start of heart attack symptoms. Ideally, the medicine should be given as soon as possible.
                

                
Percutaneous Coronary Intervention
                
Percutaneous coronary intervention is a nonsurgical procedure that opens blocked or narrowed coronary arteries. A thin, flexible tube (catheter) with a balloon or other device on the end is threaded through a blood vessel, usually in the groin (upper thigh), to the narrowed or blocked coronary artery. Once in place, the balloon located at the tip of the catheter is inflated to compress the plaque and related clot against the wall of the artery. This restores blood flow through the artery. During the procedure, the doctor may put a small mesh tube called a stent in the artery. The stent helps to keep the blood vessel open to prevent blockages in the artery in the months or years after the procedure.
                
Other Treatments for Heart Attack
                
Other treatments for heart attack include:
                
Medicines
                
Medical procedures
                
Heart-healthy lifestyle changes
                
Cardiac rehabilitation
                

                
Medicines
                
Your doctor may prescribe one or more of the following medicines.
                
ACE inhibitors. ACE inhibitors lower blood pressure and reduce strain on your heart. They also help slow down further weakening of the heart muscle.
                
Anticlotting medicines. Anticlotting medicines stop platelets from clumping together and forming unwanted blood clots. Examples of anticlotting medicines include aspirin and clopidogrel.
                
Anticoagulants. Anticoagulants, or blood thinners, prevent blood clots from forming in your arteries. These medicines also keep existing clots from getting larger.
                
Beta blockers. Beta blockers decrease your hearts workload. These medicines also are used to relieve chest pain and discomfort and to help prevent another heart attack. Beta blockers also are used to treat arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats).
                
Statin medicines. Statins control or lower your blood cholesterol. By lowering your blood cholesterol level, you can decrease your chance of having another heart attack orstroke.
                
You also may be given medicines to relieve pain and anxiety, and treat arrhythmias.Take all medicines regularly, as your doctor prescribes. Dont change the amount of your medicine or skip a dose unless your doctor tells you to.
                

                
Medical Procedures
                
Coronary artery bypass grafting also may be used to treat a heart attack. During coronary artery bypass grafting, a surgeon removes a healthy artery or vein from your body. The artery or vein is then connected, or grafted, to bypass the blocked section of the coronary artery. The grafted artery or vein bypasses (that is, goes around) the blocked portion of the coronary artery. This provides a new route for blood to flow to the heart muscle.
                

                
Heart-Healthy Lifestyle Changes
                
Treatment for a heart attack usually includes making heart-healthy lifestyle changes. Your doctor also may recommend:
                
Heart-healthy eating
                
Maintaining a healthy weight
                
Managing stress
                
Physical activity
                
Quitting smoking
                
Taking these steps can lower your chances of having another heart attack.
                

                
Heart-Healthy Eating
                
Your doctor may recommend a heart-healthy eating plan, which should include:
                
Fat-free or low-fat dairy products, such as skim milk
                
Fish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and trout, about twice a week
                
Fruits, such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes
                
Legumes, such as kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans
                
Vegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and carrots
                
Whole grains, such as oatmeal, brown rice, and corn tortillas
                
When following a heart-healthy diet, you should avoid eating:
                
A lot of red meat
                
Palm and coconut oils
                
Sugary foods and beverages
                
Two nutrients in your diet make blood cholesterol levels rise:
                
Saturated fatfound mostly in foods that come from animals
                
Trans fat (trans fatty acids)found in foods made with hydrogenated oils and fats, such as stick margarine; baked goods, such as cookies, cakes, and pies; crackers; frostings; and coffee creamers. Some trans fats also occur naturally in animal fats andmeats.
                
Saturated fat raises your blood cholesterol more than anything else in your diet. When you follow a heart-healthy eating plan, only 5 percent to 6 percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. Food labels list the amounts of saturated fat. To help you stay on track, here are some examples:
                
If you eat:
                
Try to eat no more than:
                
1,200 calories a day               
                
8 grams of saturated fat a day      
                
1,500 calories a day
                
10 grams of saturated fat a day
                
1,800 calories a day
                
12 grams of saturated fat a day
                
2,000 calories a day

Cardiac Rehabilitation
                
Your doctor may recommend cardiac rehabilitation (cardiac rehab) to help you recover from a heart attack and to help prevent another heart attack. Nearly everyone who has had a heart attack can benefit from rehab. Cardiac rehab is a medically supervised program that may help improve the health and well-being of people who have heart problems.
                
The cardiac rehab team may include doctors, nurses, exercise specialists, physical and occupational therapists, dietitians or nutritionists, and psychologists or other mental health specialists.
                
Rehab has two parts:
                
Education, counseling, and training. This part of rehab helps you understand your heart condition and find ways to reduce your risk for future heart problems. The rehab team will help you learn how to cope with the stress of adjusting to a new lifestyle and how to deal with your fears about the future.
                
Exercise training. This part helps you learn how to exercise safely, strengthen your muscles, and improve your stamina. Your exercise plan will be based on your personal abilities, needs, and interests.",treatment,Heart Attack,What are the treatments for Heart Attack ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/heartattack,"Lowering your risk factors for coronary heart disease can help you prevent a heart attack. Even if you already have coronary heart disease, you still can take steps to lower your risk for a heart attack. These steps involve following a heart-healthy lifestyle and getting ongoingmedical care.
                
Heart-Healthy Lifestyle
                
A heart-healthy lifestyle can help prevent a heart attack and includes heart-healthy eating, being physically active, quitting smoking, managing stress, and managing your weight.
                
Ongoing Care
                
Treat Related Conditions
                
Treating conditions that make a heart attack more likely also can help lower your risk for a heart attack. These conditions may include:
                
Diabetes (high blood sugar). If you have diabetes, try to control your blood sugar level through diet and physical activity (as your doctor recommends). If needed, take medicine as prescribed.
                
High blood cholesterol. Your doctor may prescribe a statin medicine to lower your cholesterol if diet and exercise arent enough.
                
High blood pressure. Your doctor may prescribe medicine to keep your blood pressure under control.
                
Have an Emergency Action Plan
                
Make sure that you have an emergency action plan in case you or someone in your family has a heart attack. This is very important if youre at high risk for, or have already had, a heart attack.
                
Write down a list of medicines you are taking, medicines you are allergic to, your health care providers phone numbers (both during and after office hours), and contact information for a friend or relative. Keep the list in a handy place (for example, fill out this wallet card) to share in a medical emergency.

NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/ms,"Heart-healthy lifestyle changes are the first line of treatment for metabolic syndrome. Lifestyle changes include heart-healthy eating, losing and maintaining a healthy weight, managing stress, physical activity, and quittingsmoking.
                
If lifestyle changes arent enough, your doctor may prescribe medicines. Medicines are used to treat and control risk factors, such as high blood pressure, high triglycerides, low HDL (good) cholesterol, and high blood sugar.
                
Goals of Treatment
                
The major goal of treating metabolic syndrome is to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease. Treatment is directed first at lowering LDL cholesterol and high blood pressure and managing diabetes (if these conditions are present).
                
The second goal of treatment is to prevent the onset of type2 diabetes, if it hasnt already developed. Long-term complications of diabetes often include heart and kidney disease, vision loss, and foot or leg amputation. If diabetes is present, the goal of treatment is to reduce your risk for heart disease by controlling all of your risk factors.
                

                
Heart-Healthy Lifestyle Changes
                
Heart-Healthy Eating
                
Heart-healthy eating is an important part of a heart-healthy lifestyle. Your doctor may recommend heart-healthy eating, which should include:
                
Fat-free or low-fat dairy products, such as skim milk
                
Fish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and trout, about twice a week
                
Fruits, such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes
                
Legumes, such as kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans
                
Vegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and carrots
                
Whole grains, such as oatmeal, brown rice, and corn tortillas
                
When following a heart-healthy diet, you should avoid eating:
                
A lot of red meat
                
Palm and coconut oils
                
Sugary foods and beverages
                
Two nutrients in your diet make blood cholesterol levels rise:
                
Saturated fatfound mostly in foods that come from animals
                
Trans fat (trans fatty acids)found in foods made with hydrogenated oils and fats, such as stick margarine; baked goods, such as cookies, cakes, and pies; crackers; frostings; and coffee creamers. Some trans fats also occur naturally in animal fats and meats.
                
Saturated fat raises your blood cholesterol more than anything else in your diet. When you follow a heart-healthy eating plan, only 5percent to 6percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. Food labels list the amounts of saturated fat. To help you stay on track, here are some examples:
                
If you eat:
                
Try to eat no more than:
                
1,200 calories a day                     
                
8 grams of saturated fat a day            
                
1,500 calories a day
                
10 grams of saturated fat a day
                
1,800 calories a day
                
12 grams of saturated fat a day
                
2,000 calories a day
                
13 grams of saturated fat a day
                
2,500 calories a day
                
17 grams of saturated fat a day
                
Not all fats are bad. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats actually help lower blood cholesterol levels. Some sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are:
                
Avocados
                
Corn, sunflower, and soybean oils
                
Nuts and seeds, such as walnuts
                
Olive, canola, peanut, safflower, and sesame oils
                
Peanut butter
                
Salmon and trout
                
Tofu
                
Sodium
                
You should try to limit the amount of sodium that you eat. This means choosing and preparing foods that are lower in salt and sodium. Try to use low-sodium and no added salt foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. Food labels tell you what you need to know about choosing foods that are lower in sodium. Try to eat no more than 2,300milligrams of sodium a day. If you have high blood pressure, you may need to restrict your sodium intake even more.
                
Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension
                
Your doctor may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan if you have high blood pressure. The DASH eating plan focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and low in fat, cholesterol, and sodium and salt.
                
The DASH eating plan is a good heart-healthy eating plan, even for those who dont have high blood pressure. Read more about DASH.
                
Limiting Alcohol
                
Try to limit alcohol intake. Too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure and triglyceride levels, a type of fat found in the blood. Alcohol also adds extra calories, which may cause weightgain.
                
Men should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day. Women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day. One drink is:
                
12 ounces of beer
                
5 ounces of wine
                
1 ounces of liquor
                

                
Maintaining a Healthy Weight
                
If you have metabolic syndrome and are overweight or obese, your doctor will recommend weight loss. He or she can help you create a weight-loss plan and goals. Maintaining a healthy weight can lower your risk for metabolic syndrome, coronary heart disease, and other health problems. Aim for a Healthy Weight by following a heart-healthy eating plan and keeping physically active.
                
Knowing your body mass index (BMI) helps you find out if youre a healthy weight in relation to your height and gives an estimate of your total body fat. To figure out your BMI, check out the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes (NHLBI) online BMI calculator or talk to your doctor. A BMI:
                
Below 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight.
                
Between 18.5 and 24.9 is in the normal range.
                
Between 25.0 and 29.9 is considered overweight.
                
Of 30.0 or higher is considered obese.
                
A general goal to aim for is a BMI of less than 25. Your doctor or health care provider can help you set an appropriate BMI goal.
                
Measuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. If most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type2 diabetes. This risk may be higher with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men.
                
If youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. A loss of just 3percent to 5percent of your current weight can lower your triglycerides, blood glucose, and the risk of developing type2 diabetes. Greater amounts of weight loss can improve blood pressure readings, lower LDL (bad) cholesterol, and increase HDL cholesterol.
                

                
Managing Stress
                
Learning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health. Consider healthy stress-reducing activities, such as:
                
A stress management program
                
Meditation
                
Physical activity
                
Relaxation therapy
                
Talking things out with friends or family
                

                
Physical Activity
                
Regular physical activity can lower your risk for metabolic syndrome, coronary heart disease, and other health problems. Everyone should try to participate in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2hours and 30minutes per week or vigorous aerobic exercise for 1hour and 15minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats faster and you use more oxygen than usual. The more active you are, the more you will benefit. Participate in aerobic exercise for at least 10minutes at a time spread throughout the week.
                
Talk with your doctor before you start a new exercise plan. Ask your doctor how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you.

Medicines
                
Sometimes lifestyle changes arent enough to control your risk factors for metabolic syndrome. For example, you may need statin medications to control or lower your cholesterol. By lowering your blood cholesterol level, you can decrease your chance of having a heart attack or stroke. Doctors usually prescribe statins for people who have:
                
Diabetes
                
Heart disease or had a prior stroke
                
High LDL cholesterol levels
                
Doctors may discuss beginning statin treatment with those who have an elevated risk for developing heart disease or having a stroke.
                
Your doctor also may prescribe other medications to:
                
Decrease your chance of having a heart attack or dying suddenly.
                
Lower your blood pressure.
                
Prevent blood clots, which can lead to heart attack or stroke.
                
Reduce your hearts workload and relieve symptoms of coronary heart disease.
                
Take all medicines regularly, as your doctor prescribes. Dont change the amount of your medicine or skip a dose unless your doctor tells you to. You should still follow a heart-healthy lifestyle, even if you take medicines to treat your risk factors for metabolic syndrome.",treatment,Metabolic Syndrome,What are the treatments for Metabolic Syndrome ?,Drugs

NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/fanconi,"Doctors decide how to treat Fanconi anemia (FA) based on a person's age and how well the person's bone marrow is making new blood cells.
                
Goals of Treatment
                
Long-term treatments for FA can:
                
Cure the anemia. Damaged bone marrow cells are replaced with healthy ones that can make enough of all three types of blood cells on their own.
                
Or
                
Treat the symptoms without curing the cause. This is done using medicines and other substances that can help your body make more blood cells for a limited time.
                
Screening and Short-Term Treatment
                
Even if you or your child has FA, your bone marrow might still be able to make enough new blood cells. If so, your doctor might suggest frequent blood count checks so he or she can watch your condition.
                
Your doctor will probably want you to have bone marrow tests once a year. He or she also will screen you for any signs of cancer or tumors.
                
If your blood counts begin to drop sharply and stay low, your bone marrow might be failing. Your doctor may prescribe antibiotics to help your body fight infections. In the short term, he or she also may want to give you blood transfusions to increase your blood cell counts to normal levels.
                
However, long-term use of blood transfusions can reduce the chance that other treatments will work.
                
Long-Term Treatment
                
The four main types of long-term treatment for FA are:
                
Blood and marrow stem cell transplant
                
Androgen therapy
                
Synthetic growth factors
                
Gene therapy
                
Blood and Marrow Stem Cell Transplant
                
A blood and marrow stem cell transplant is the current standard treatment for patients who have FA that's causing major bone marrow failure. Healthy stem cells from another person, called a donor, are used to replace the faulty cells in your bone marrow.
                
If you're going to receive stem cells from another person, your doctor will want to find a donor whose stem cells match yours as closely as possible.
                
Stem cell transplants are most successful in younger people who:
                
Have few or no serious health problems
                
Receive stem cells from a brother or sister who is a good donor match 
                
Have had few or no previous blood transfusions
                
During the transplant, you'll get donated stem cells in a procedure that's like a blood transfusion. Once the new stem cells are in your body, they travel to your bone marrow and begin making new blood cells.
                
A successful stem cell transplant will allow your body to make enough of all three types of blood cells.
                
Even if you've had a stem cell transplant to treat FA, youre still at risk for some types of blood cancer and cancerous solid tumors. Your doctor will check your health regularly after the procedure.
                
For more information about stem cell transplantsincluding finding a donor, having the procedure, and learning about the risksgo to the Health Topics Blood and Marrow Stem Cell Transplant article.
                
Androgen Therapy
                
Before improvements made stem cell transplants more effective, androgen therapy was the standard treatment for people who had FA. Androgens are man-made male hormones that can help your body make more blood cells for long periods.
                
Androgens increase your red blood cell and platelet counts. They don't work as well at raising your white blood cell count.
                
Unlike a stem cell transplant, androgens don't allow your bone marrow to make enough of all three types of blood cells on its own. You may need ongoing treatment with androgens to control the effects of FA.
                
Also, over time, androgens lose their ability to help your body make more blood cells, which means you'll need other treatments.
                
Androgen therapy can have serious side effects, such as liver disease. This treatment also can't prevent you from developing leukemia (a type of blood cancer).
                
Synthetic Growth Factors
                
Your doctor may choose to treat your FA with growth factors. These are substances found in your body, but they also can be man-made.
                
Growth factors help your body make more red and white blood cells. Growth factors that help your body make more platelets still are being studied.
                
More research is needed on growth factor treatment for FA. Early results suggest that growth factors may have fewer and less serious side effects than androgens.
                
Gene Therapy
                
Researchers are looking for ways to replace faulty FA genes with normal, healthy genes. They hope these genes will make proteins that can repair and protect your bone marrow cells. Early results of this therapy hold promise, but more research is needed.
                
Surgery
                
FA can cause birth defects that affect the arms, thumbs, hips, legs, and other parts of the body. Doctors may recommend surgery to repair some defects.
                
For example, your child might be born with a ventricular septal defecta hole or defect in the wall that separates the lower chambers of the heart. His or her doctor may recommend surgery to close the hole so the heart can work properly.
                
Children who have FA also may need surgery to correct digestive system problems that can harm their nutrition, growth, and survival.
                
One of the most common problems is an FA-related birth defect in which the trachea (windpipe), which carries air to the lungs, is connected to the esophagus, which carries food to the stomach.
                
This can cause serious breathing, swallowing, and eating problems and can lead to lung infections. Surgery is needed to separate the two organs and allow normal eating and breathing.",treatment,Fanconi Anemia,What are the treatments for Fanconi Anemia ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/fanconi,"ou can't prevent Fanconi anemia (FA) because it's an inherited disease. If a child gets two copies of the same faulty FA gene, he or she will have the disease.
                
If you're at high risk for FA and are planning to have children, you may want to consider genetic counseling. A counselor can help you understand your risk of having a child who has FA. He or she also can explain the choices that are available to you.
                
If you're already pregnant, genetic testing can show whether your child has FA. For more information on genetic testing, go to ""How Is Fanconi Anemia Diagnosed?""
                
In the United States, Ashkenazi Jews (Jews of Eastern European descent) are at higher risk for FA than other ethnic groups. For Ashkenazi Jews, it's recommended that prospective parents get tested for FA-related gene mutations before getting pregnant.
                
Preventing Complications
                
If you or your child has FA, you can prevent some health problems related to the disorder. Pneumonia, hepatitis, and chicken pox can occur more often and more severely in people who have FA compared with those who don't. Ask your doctor about vaccines for these conditions.
                
People who have FA also are at higher risk than other people for some cancers. These cancers include leukemia (a type of blood cancer), myelodysplastic syndrome (abnormal levels of all three types of blood cells), and liver cancer. Screening and early detection can help manage these life-threatening diseases.",prevention,Fanconi Anemia,How to prevent Fanconi Anemia ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/dic,"Treatment for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) depends on its severity and cause. The main goals of treating DIC are to control bleeding and clotting problems and treat the underlying cause.
                
Acute Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation
                
People who have acute DIC may have severe bleeding that requires emergency treatment in a hospital. Treatment may include blood transfusions, medicines, and oxygen therapy. (Oxygen is given through nasal prongs, a mask, or a breathing tube.)
                
A blood transfusion is a safe, common procedure. You receive blood through an intravenous (IV) line in one of your blood vessels. Blood transfusions are done to replace blood loss due to an injury, surgery, or illness.
                
Blood is made up of various parts, including red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and plasma. Some blood transfusions involve whole blood (blood with all of its parts). More often though, only some parts of blood are transfused.
                
If you have DIC, you may be given platelets and clotting factors, red blood cells, and plasma (the liquid part of blood).
                
Chronic Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation
                
People who have chronic DIC are more likely to have blood clotting problems than bleeding. If you have chronic DIC, your doctor may treat you with medicines called anticoagulants, or blood thinners.
                
Blood thinners help prevent blood clots from forming. They also keep existing blood clots from getting larger.",treatment,Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation,What are the treatments for Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation ?,Drugs

Setting realistic weight-loss goals is an important first step to losing weight.
                
For Adults
                
Try to lose 5 to 10 percent of your current weight over 6 months. This will lower your risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) and other conditions.
                
The best way to lose weight is slowly. A weight loss of 1 to 2 pounds a week is do-able, safe, and will help you keep off the weight. It also will give you the time to make new, healthy lifestyle changes.
                
If you've lost 10 percent of your body weight, have kept it off for 6 months, and are still overweight or obese, you may want to consider further weight loss.
                
For Children and Teens
                
If your child is overweight or at risk for overweight or obesity, the goal is to maintain his or her current weight and to focus on eating healthy and being physically active. This should be part of a family effort to make lifestyle changes.
                
If your child is overweight or obese and has a health condition related to overweight or obesity, your doctor may refer you to a pediatric obesity treatment center.
                
Lifestyle Changes
                
Lifestyle changes can help you and your family achieve long-term weight-loss success. Example of lifestyle changes include:
                
Focusing on balancing energy IN (calories from food and drinks) with energy OUT (physical activity)
                
Following a healthy eating plan
                
Learning how to adopt healthy lifestyle habits
                
Over time, these changes will become part of your everyday life.
                
Calories
                
Cutting back on calories (energy IN) will help you lose weight. To lose 1 to 2pounds a week, adults should cut back their calorie intake by 500 to 1,000calories a day.
                
In general, having 1,000 to 1,200 calories a day will help most women lose weight safely.
                
In general, having 1,200 to 1,600 calories a day will help most men lose weight safely. This calorie range also is suitable for women who weigh 165pounds or more or who exercise routinely.
                
These calorie levels are a guide and may need to be adjusted. If you eat 1,600calories a day but don't lose weight, then you may want to cut back to 1,200calories. If you're hungry on either diet, then you may want to add 100 to 200calories a day.
                
Very low-calorie diets with fewer than 800 calories a day shouldn't be used unless your doctor is monitoring you.
                
For overweight children and teens, it's important to slow the rate of weight gain. However, reduced-calorie diets aren't advised unless you talk with a health care provider.
                
Healthy Eating Plan
                
A healthy eating plan gives your body the nutrients it needs every day. It has enough calories for good health, but not so many that you gain weight.
                
A healthy eating plan is low in saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium (salt), and added sugar. Following a healthy eating plan will lower your risk for heart disease and other conditions.
                
Healthy foods include:
                
Fat-free and low-fat dairy products, such as low-fat yogurt, cheese, and milk.
                
Protein foods, such as lean meat, fish, poultry without skin, beans, and peas.
                
Whole-grain foods, such as whole-wheat bread, oatmeal, and brown rice. Other grain foods include pasta, cereal, bagels, bread, tortillas, couscous, and crackers.
                
Fruits, which can be fresh, canned, frozen, or dried.
                
Vegetables, which can be fresh, canned (without salt), frozen, or dried.
                
Canola and olive oils, and soft margarines made from these oils, are heart healthy. However, you should use them in small amounts because they're high in calories.
                
You also can include unsalted nuts, like walnuts and almonds, in your diet as long as you limit the amount you eat (nuts also are high in calories).
                
The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's ""Aim for a Healthy Weight"" patient booklet provides more information about following a healthy eating plan.
                
Foods to limit. Foods that are high in saturated and trans fats and cholesterol raise blood cholesterol levels and also might be high in calories. Fats and cholesterol raise your risk for heart disease, so they should be limited.
                
Saturated fat is found mainly in:
                
Fatty cuts of meat, such as ground beef, sausage, and processed meats (for example, bologna, hot dogs, and deli meats)
                
Poultry with the skin
                
High-fat dairy products like whole-milk cheeses, whole milk, cream, butter, and ice cream
                
Lard, coconut, and palm oils, which are found in many processed foods
                
Trans fat is found mainly in:
                
Foods with partially hydrogenated oils, such as many hard margarines and shortening
                
Baked products and snack foods, such as crackers, cookies, doughnuts, and breads
                
Foods fried in hydrogenated shortening, such as french fries and chicken
                
Cholesterol mainly is found in:
                
Egg yolks
                
Organ meats, such as liver
                
Shrimp
                
Whole milk or whole-milk products, such as butter, cream, and cheese
                
Limiting foods and drinks with added sugars, like high-fructose corn syrup, is important. Added sugars will give you extra calories without nutrients like vitamins and minerals. Added sugars are found in many desserts, canned fruit packed in syrup, fruit drinks, and nondiet drinks.
                
Check the list of ingredients on food packages for added sugars like high-fructose corn syrup. Drinks that contain alcohol also will add calories, so it's a good idea to limit your alcohol intake.
                
Portion size. A portion is the amount of food that you choose to eat for a meal or snack. It's different from a serving, which is a measured amount of food and is noted on the Nutrition Facts label on food packages.
                
Anyone who has eaten out lately is likely to notice how big the portions are. In fact, over the past 40 years, portion sizes have grown significantly. These growing portion sizes have changed what we think of as a normal portion.
                
Cutting back on portion size is a good way to eat fewer calories and balance your energy IN.
                
Food weight. Studies have shown that we all tend to eat a constant ""weight"" of food. Ounce for ounce, our food intake is fairly consistent. Knowing this, you can lose weight if you eat foods that are lower in calories and fat for a given amount of food.
                
For example, replacing a full-fat food product that weighs 2 ounces with a low-fat product that weighs the same helps you cut back on calories. Another helpful practice is to eat foods that contain a lot of water, such as vegetables, fruits, and soups.
                
Physical Activity
                
Being physically active and eating fewer calories will help you lose weight and keep weight off over time. Physical activity also will benefit you in other ways. It will:
                
Lower your risk for heart disease, heart attack, diabetes, and cancers (such as breast, uterine, and colon cancers)
                
Strengthen your heart and help your lungs work better
                
Strengthen your muscles and keep your joints in good condition
                
Slow bone loss
                
Give you more energy
                
Help you relax and better cope with stress
                
Allow you to fall asleep more quickly and sleep more soundly
                
Give you an enjoyable way to share time with friends and family
                
The four main types of physical activity are aerobic, muscle-strengthening, bone strengthening, and stretching. You can do physical activity with light, moderate, or vigorous intensity. The level of intensity depends on how hard you have to work to do the activity.
                
People vary in the amount of physical activity they need to control their weight. Many people can maintain their weight by doing 150 to 300 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes to 5 hours) of moderate-intensity activity per week, such as brisk walking.
                
People who want to lose a large amount of weight (more than 5 percent of their body weight) may need to do more than 300 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week. This also may be true for people who want to keep off weight that they've lost.
                
You don't have to do the activity all at once. You can break it up into short periods of at least 10 minutes each.
                
If you have a heart problem or chronic disease, such as heart disease, diabetes, or high blood pressure, talk with your doctor about what types of physical activity are safe for you. You also should talk with your doctor about safe physical activities if you have symptoms such as chest pain or dizziness.
                
Children should get at least 60 minutes or more of physical activity every day. Most physical activity should be moderate-intensity aerobic activity. Activity should vary and be a good fit for the child's age and physical development.
                
Many people lead inactive lives and might not be motivated to do more physical activity. When starting a physical activity program, some people may need help and supervision to avoid injury.
                
If you're obese, or if you haven't been active in the past, start physical activity slowly and build up the intensity a little at a time.
                
When starting out, one way to be active is to do more everyday activities, such as taking the stairs instead of the elevator and doing household chores and yard work. The next step is to start walking, biking, or swimming at a slow pace, and then build up the amount of time you exercise or the intensity level of the activity.
                
To lose weight and gain better health, it's important to get moderate-intensity physical activity. Choose activities that you enjoy and that fit into your daily life.
                
A daily, brisk walk is an easy way to be more active and improve your health. Use a pedometer to count your daily steps and keep track of how much you're walking. Try to increase the number of steps you take each day. Other examples of moderate-intensity physical activity include dancing, gardening, and water aerobics.
                
For greater health benefits, try to step up your level of activity or the length of time you're active. For example, start walking for 10 to 15 minutes three times a week, and then build up to brisk walking for 60 minutes, 5 days a week.

Behavioral Changes
                
Changing your behaviors or habits related to food and physical activity is important for losing weight. The first step is to understand which habits lead you to overeat or have an inactive lifestyle. The next step is to change these habits.
                
Below are some simple tips to help you adopt healthier habits.
                
Change your surroundings. You might be more likely to overeat when watching TV, when treats are available at work, or when you're with a certain friend. You also might find it hard to motivate yourself to be physically active. However, you can change these habits.
                
Instead of watching TV, dance to music in your living room or go for a walk.
                
Leave the office break room right after you get a cup of coffee.
                
Bring a change of clothes to work. Head straight to an exercise class on the way home from work.
                
Put a note on your calendar to remind yourself to take a walk or go to your exercise class.
                
Keep a record. A record of your food intake and the amount of physical activity that you do each day will help inspire you. You also can keep track of your weight. For example, when the record shows that you've been meeting your physical activity goals, you'll want to keep it up. A record also is an easy way to track how you're doing, especially if you're working with a registered dietitian or nutritionist.
                
Seek support. Ask for help or encouragement from your friends, family, and health care provider. You can get support in person, through e-mail, or by talking on the phone. You also can join a support group.
                
Reward success. Reward your success for meeting your weight-loss goals or other achievements with something you would like to do, not with food. Choose rewards that you'll enjoy, such as a movie, music CD, an afternoon off from work, a massage, or personal time.
                
Weight-Loss Medicines
                
Weight-loss medicines approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) might be an option for some people.
                
If you're not successful at losing 1 pound a week after 6months of using lifestyle changes, medicines may help. You should only use medicines as part of a program that includes diet, physical activity, and behavioral changes.
                
Weight-loss medicines might be suitable for adults who are obese (a BMI of 30 or greater). People who have BMIs of 27 or greater, and who are at risk for heart disease and other health conditions, also may benefit from weight-loss medicines.
                
Sibutramine (Meridia)
                
As of October 2010, the weight-loss medicine sibutramine (Meridia) was taken off the market in the United States. Research showed that the medicine may raise the risk of heart attack and stroke. 
                
Orlistat (Xenical and Alli)
                
Orlistat (Xenical) causes a weight loss between 5 and 10 pounds, although some people lose more weight. Most of the weight loss occurs within the first 6 months of taking the medicine.
                
People taking Xenical need regular checkups with their doctors, especially during the first year of taking the medicine. During checkups, your doctor will check your weight, blood pressure, and pulse and may recommend other tests. He or she also will talk with you about any medicine side effects and answer your questions.
                
The FDA also has approved Alli, an over-the-counter (OTC) weight-loss aid for adults. Alli is the lower dose form of orlistat. Alli is meant to be used along with a reduced-calorie, low-fat diet and physical activity. In studies, most people taking Alli lost 5 to 10pounds over 6 months.
                
Both Xenical and Alli reduce the absorption of fats, fat calories, and vitamins A, D, E, and K to promote weight loss. Both medicines also can cause mild side effects, such as oily and loose stools.
                
Although rare, some reports of liver disease have occurred with the use of orlistat. More research is needed to find out whether the medicine plays a role in causing liver disease. Talk with your doctor if youre considering using Xenical or Alli to lose weight. He or she can discuss the risks and benefits with you.
                
You also should talk with your doctor before starting orlistat if youre taking blood-thinning medicines or being treated for diabetes or thyroid disease. Also, ask your doctor whether you should take a multivitamin due to the possible loss of some vitamins.
                
Lorcaserin Hydrochloride (Belviq) and Qsymia
                
In July 2012, the FDA approved two new medicines for chronic (ongoing) weight management. Lorcaserin hydrochloride (Belviq) and Qsymia are approved for adults who have a BMI of 30 or greater. (Qsymia is a combination of two FDA-approved medicines: phentermine and topiramate.)
                
These medicines also are approved for adults with a BMI of 27 or greater who have at least one weight-related condition, such as high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, or high blood cholesterol.
                
Both medicines are meant to be used along with a reduced-calorie diet and physical activity.
                
Other Medicines
                
Some prescription medicines are used for weight loss, but aren't FDA-approved for treating obesity. They include:
                
Medicines to treat depression. Some medicines for depression cause an initial weight loss and then a regain of weight while taking the medicine.
                
Medicines to treat seizures. Two medicines used for seizures, topiramate and zonisamide, have been shown to cause weight loss. These medicines are being studied to see whether they will be useful in treating obesity.
                
Medicines to treat diabetes. Metformin may cause small amounts of weight loss in people who have obesity and diabetes. It's not known how this medicine causes weight loss, but it has been shown to reduce hunger and food intake.
                
Over-the-Counter Products
                
Some OTC products claim to promote weight loss. The FDA doesn't regulate these products because they're considered dietary supplements, not medicines.
                
However, many of these products have serious side effects and generally aren't recommended. Some of these OTC products include:
                
Ephedra (also called ma huang). Ephedra comes from plants and has been sold as a dietary supplement. The active ingredient in the plant is called ephedrine. Ephedra can cause short-term weight loss, but it also has serious side effects. It causes high blood pressure and stresses the heart. In 2004, the FDA banned the sale of dietary supplements containing ephedra in the United States.
                
Chromium. This is a mineral that's sold as a dietary supplement to reduce body fat. While studies haven't found any weight-loss benefit from chromium, there are few serious side effects from taking it.
                
Diuretics and herbal laxatives. These products cause you to lose water weight, not fat. They also can lower your body's potassium levels, which may cause heart and muscle problems.
                
Hoodia. Hoodia is a cactus that's native to Africa. It's sold in pill form as an appetite suppressant. However, no firm evidence shows that hoodia works. No large-scale research has been done on humans to show whether hoodia is effective or safe.
                
Weight-Loss Surgery
                
Weight-loss surgery might be an option for people who have extreme obesity (BMI of 40 or more) when other treatments have failed.
                
Weight-loss surgery also is an option for people who have a BMI of 35 or more and life-threatening conditions, such as:
                
Severe sleep apnea (a condition in which you have one or more pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while you sleep)
                
Obesity-related cardiomyopathy (KAR-de-o-mi-OP-ah-thee; diseases of the heart muscle)
                
Severe type 2 diabetes
                
Types of Weight-Loss Surgery
                
Two common weight-loss surgeries include banded gastroplasty and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. For gastroplasty, a band or staples are used to create a small pouch at the top of your stomach. This surgery limits the amount of food and liquids the stomach can hold.
                
For gastric bypass, a small stomach pouch is created with a bypass around part of the small intestine where most of the calories you eat are absorbed. This surgery limits food intake and reduces the calories your body absorbs.
                
Weight-loss surgery can improve your health and weight. However, the surgery can be risky, depending on your overall health. Gastroplasty has few long-term side effects, but you must limit your food intake dramatically.
                
Gastric bypass has more side effects. They include nausea (feeling sick to your stomach), bloating, diarrhea, and faintness. These side effects are all part of a condition called dumping syndrome. After gastric bypass, you may need multivitamins and minerals to prevent nutrient deficiencies.
                
Lifelong medical followup is needed after both surgeries. Your doctor also may recommend a program both before and after surgery to help you with diet, physical activity, and coping skills.
                
If you think you would benefit from weight-loss surgery, talk with your doctor. Ask whether you're a candidate for the surgery and discuss the risks, benefits, and what to expect.
                
Weight-Loss Maintenance
                
Maintaining your weight loss over time can be a challenge. For adults, weight loss is a success if you lose at least 10 percent of your initial weight and you don't regain more than 6 or 7 pounds in 2 years. You also must keep a lower waist circumference (at least 2 inches lower than your waist circumference before you lost weight).
                
After 6 months of keeping off the weight, you can think about losing more if:
                
You've already lost 5 to 10 percent of your body weight
                
You're still overweight or obese
                
The key to losing more weight or maintaining your weight loss is to continue with lifestyle changes. Adopt these changes as a new way of life.
                
If you want to lose more weight, you may need to eat fewer calories and increase your activity level. For example, if you eat 1,600 calories a day but don't lose weight, you may want to cut back to 1,200 calories. It's also important to make physical activity part of your normal daily routine.",treatment,Overweight and Obesity,What are the treatments for Overweight and Obesity ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/obe,"Following a healthy lifestyle can help you prevent overweight and obesity. Many lifestyle habits begin during childhood. Thus, parents and families should encourage their children to make healthy choices, such as following a healthy diet and being physically active.
                
Make following a healthy lifestyle a family goal. For example:
                
Follow a healthy eating plan. Make healthy food choices, keep your calorie needs and your family's calorie needs in mind, and focus on the balance of energy IN and energy OUT.
                
Focus on portion size. Watch the portion sizes in fast food and other restaurants. The portions served often are enough for two or three people. Children's portion sizes should be smaller than those for adults. Cutting back on portion size will help you balance energy IN and energy OUT.
                
Be active. Make personal and family time active. Find activities that everyone will enjoy. For example, go for a brisk walk, bike or rollerblade, or train together for a walk or run.
                
Reduce screen time. Limit the use of TVs, computers, DVDs, and videogames because they limit time for physical activity. Health experts recommend 2hours or less a day of screen time that's not work- or homework-related.
                
Keep track of your weight, body mass index, and waist circumference. Also, keep track of your children's growth.
                
Led by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, four Institutes from the National Institutes of Health have come together to promote We Can!Ways to Enhance Children's Activity & Nutrition.
                
We Can! is a national education program designed for parents and caregivers to help children 8 to 13 years old maintain a healthy weight. The evidence-based program offers parents and families tips and fun activities to encourage healthy eating, increase physical activity, and reduce time spent being inactive.
                
Currently, more than 140 community groups around the country are participating in We Can! programs for parents and youth. These community groups include hospitals, health departments, clinics, faith-based organizations, YMCAs, schools, and more.

NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/hbc,"High blood cholesterol is treated with lifestyle changes and medicines. The main goal of treatment is to lower your low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level enough to reduce your risk for coronary heart disease, heart attack, and other related health problems.
                
Your risk for heart disease and heart attack goes up as your LDL cholesterol level rises and your number of heart disease risk factors increases.
                
Some people are at high risk for heart attacks because they already have heart disease. Other people are at high risk for heart disease because they have diabetes or more than one heart disease risk factor.
                
Talk with your doctor about lowering your cholesterol and your risk for heart disease. Also, check the list to find out whether you have risk factors that affect your LDL cholesterol goal:
                
Cigarette smoking
                
High blood pressure (140/90 mmHg or higher), or youre on medicine to treat high blood pressure
                
Low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (less than 40 mg/dL)
                
Family history of early heart disease (heart disease in father or brother before age 55; heart disease in mother or sister before age 65)
                
Age (men 45 years or older; women 55 years or older)
                
You can use the NHLBI 10-Year Risk Calculator to find your risk score. The score, given as a percentage, refers to your chance of having a heart attack in the next 10years.
                
Based on your medical history, number of risk factors, and risk score, figure out your risk of getting heart disease or having a heart attack using the table below.
                
* Some people in this category are at very high risk because theyve just had a heart attack or they have diabetes and heart disease, severe risk factors, or metabolic syndrome. If youre at very high risk, your doctor may set your LDL goal even lower, to less than 70 mg/dL. Your doctor also may set your LDL goal at this lower level if you have heart disease alone.
                
After following the above steps, you should have an idea about your risk for heart disease and heart attack. The two main ways to lower your cholesterol (and, thus, your heart disease risk) include:
                
Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC). TLC is a three-part program that includes a healthy diet, weight management, and physical activity. TLC is for anyone whose LDL cholesterol level is above goal.
                
Medicines. If cholesterol-lowering medicines are needed, theyre used with the TLC program to help lower your LDL cholesterol level.
                
Your doctor will set your LDL goal. The higher your risk for heart disease, the lower he or she will set your LDL goal. Using the following guide, you and your doctor can create a plan for treating your high blood cholesterol.
                
Category I, high risk, your LDL goal is less than 100 mg/dL.*
                
* Your LDL goal may be set even lower, to less than 70 mg/dL, if youre at very high risk or if you have heart disease. If you have this lower goal and your LDL is 70 mg/dL or higher, youll need to begin the TLC diet and take medicines as prescribed.
                
Category II, moderately high risk, your LDL goal is less than 130 mg/dL
                
Category III, moderate risk, your LDL goal is less than 130 mg/dL.
                
Category IV, low to moderate risk, your LDL goal is less than 160 mg/dL.
                

                
Lowering Cholesterol Using Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes
                

                
TLC is a set of lifestyle changes that can help you lower your LDL cholesterol. The main parts of the TLC program are a healthy diet, weight management, and physical activity.
                
The TLC Diet
                
With the TLC diet, less than 7 percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. This kind of fat is found in some meats, dairy products, chocolate, baked goods, and deep-fried and processed foods.
                
No more than 25 to 35 percent of your daily calories should come from all fats, including saturated, trans, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fats.
                
You also should have less than 200 mg a day of cholesterol. The amounts of cholesterol and the types of fat in prepared foods can be found on the foods' Nutrition Facts labels.
                
Foods high in soluble fiber also are part of the TLC diet. They help prevent the digestive tract from absorbing cholesterol. These foods include:
                
Whole-grain cereals such as oatmeal and oat bran
                
Fruits such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes
                
Legumes such as kidney beans, lentils, chick peas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans
                
A diet rich in fruits and vegetables can increase important cholesterol-lowering compounds in your diet. These compounds, called plant stanols or sterols, work like soluble fiber.
                
A healthy diet also includes some types of fish, such as salmon, tuna (canned or fresh), and mackerel. These fish are a good source of omega-3 fatty acids. These acids may help protect the heart from blood clots and inflammation and reduce the risk of heart attack. Try to have about two fish meals every week.
                
You also should try to limit the amount of sodium (salt) that you eat. This means choosing low-salt and ""no added salt"" foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. The Nutrition Facts label on food packaging shows the amount of sodium in the item.
                
Try to limit drinks with alcohol. Too much alcohol will raise your blood pressure and triglyceride level. (Triglycerides are a type of fat found in the blood.) Alcohol also adds extra calories, which will cause weight gain.
                
Men should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day. Women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day. One drink is a glass of wine, beer, or a small amount of hard liquor.
                
For more information about TLC, go to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes (NHLBIs) ""Your Guide to Lowering Your Cholesterol With TLC.""
                
Weight Management
                
If youre overweight or obese, losing weight can help lower LDL cholesterol. Maintaining a healthy weight is especially important if you have a condition called metabolic syndrome.
                
Metabolic syndrome is the name for a group of risk factors that raise your risk for heart disease and other health problems, such as diabetes and stroke.
                
The five metabolic risk factors are a large waistline (abdominal obesity), a high triglyceride level, a low HDL cholesterol level, high blood pressure, and high blood sugar. Metabolic syndrome is diagnosed if you have at least three of these metabolic risk factors.
                
Physical Activity
                
Routine physical activity can lower LDL cholesterol and triglycerides and raise your HDL cholesterol level.
                
People gain health benefits from as little as 60 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week. The more active you are, the more you will benefit.
                
For more information about physical activity, go to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' ""2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans,"" the Health Topics Physical Activity and Your Heart article, and the NHLBI's ""Your Guide to Physical Activity and Your Heart.""
                
Cholesterol-Lowering Medicines
                
In addition to lifestyle changes, your doctor may prescribe medicines to help lower your cholesterol. Even with medicines, you should continue the TLC program.
                
Medicines can help control high blood cholesterol, but they dont cure it. Thus, you must continue taking your medicine to keep your cholesterol level in the recommended range.
                
The five major types of cholesterol-lowering medicines are statins, bile acid sequestrants (seh-KWES-trants), nicotinic (nick-o-TIN-ick) acid, fibrates, and ezetimibe.
                
Statins work well at lowering LDL cholesterol. These medicines are safe for most people. Rare side effects include muscle and liver problems.
                
Bile acid sequestrants also help lower LDL cholesterol. These medicines usually arent prescribed as the only medicine to lower cholesterol. Sometimes theyre prescribed with statins.
                
Nicotinic acid lowers LDL cholesterol and triglycerides and raises HDL cholesterol. You should only use this type of medicine with a doctors supervision.
                
Fibrates lower triglycerides, and they may raise HDL cholesterol. When used with statins, fibrates may increase the risk of muscle problems.
                
Ezetimibe lowers LDL cholesterol. This medicine works by blocking the intestine from absorbing cholesterol.
                
While youre being treated for high blood cholesterol, youll need ongoing care. Your doctor will want to make sure your cholesterol levels are controlled. He or she also will want to check for other health problems.
                
If needed, your doctor may prescribe medicines for other health problems. Take all medicines exactly as your doctor prescribes. The combination of medicines may lower your risk for heart disease and heart attack.
                
While trying to manage your cholesterol, take steps to manage other heart disease risk factors too. For example, if you have high blood pressure, work with your doctor to lower it.
                
If you smoke, quit. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke. If youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. Your doctor can help you create a reasonable weight-loss plan.",treatment,High Blood Cholesterol,What are the treatments for High Blood Cholesterol ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/aps,"Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) has no cure. However, medicines can help prevent complications. The goals of treatment are to prevent blood clots from forming and keep existing clots from getting larger.
                
You may have APS and another autoimmune disorder, such as lupus. If so, it's important to control that condition as well. When the other condition is controlled, APS may cause fewer problems.
                
Research is ongoing for new ways to treat APS.
                
Medicines
                
Anticoagulants, or ""blood thinners,"" are used to stop blood clots from forming. They also may keep existing blood clots from getting larger. These medicines are taken as either a pill, an injection under the skin, or through a needle or tube inserted into a vein (called intravenous, or IV, injection).
                
Warfarin and heparin are two blood thinners used to treat APS. Warfarin is given in pill form. (Coumadin is a common brand name for warfarin.) Heparin is given as an injection or through an IV tube. There are different types of heparin. Your doctor will discuss the options with you.
                
Your doctor may treat you with both heparin and warfarin at the same time. Heparin acts quickly. Warfarin takes 2 to 3 days before it starts to work. Once the warfarin starts to work, the heparin is stopped.
                
Aspirin also thins the blood and helps prevent blood clots. Sometimes aspirin is used with warfarin. Other times, aspirin might be used alone.
                
Blood thinners don't prevent APS. They simply reduce the risk of further blood clotting. Treatment with these medicines is long term. Discuss all treatment options with your doctor.
                
Side Effects
                
The most common side effect of blood thinners is bleeding. This happens if the medicine thins your blood too much. This side effect can be life threatening.
                
Sometimes the bleeding is internal (inside your body). People treated with blood thinners usually need regular blood tests, called PT and PTT tests, to check how well their blood is clotting.
                
These tests also show whether you're taking the right amount of medicine. Your doctor will check to make sure that you're taking enough medicine to prevent clots, but not so much that it causes bleeding.
                
Talk with your doctor about the warning signs of internal bleeding and when to seek emergency care. (For more information, go to ""Living With Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome."")
                
Treatment During Pregnancy
                
Pregnant women who have APS can have successful pregnancies. With proper treatment, these women are more likely to carry their babies to term.
                
Pregnant women who have APS usually are treated with heparin or heparin and low-dose aspirin. Warfarin is not used as a treatment during pregnancy because it can harm the fetus.
                
Babies whose mothers have APS are at higher risk for slowed growth while in the womb. If you're pregnant and have APS, you may need to have extra ultrasound tests (sonograms) to check your babys growth. An ultrasound test uses sound waves to look at the growing fetus.
                
Treatment for Other Medical Conditions
                
People who have APS are at increased risk for thrombocytopenia. This is a condition in which your blood has a lower than normal number of blood cell fragments called platelets. Platelets help the blood clot.
                
If you have APS, you'll need regular complete blood counts (a type of blood test) to count the number of platelets in your blood.
                
Thrombocytopenia is treated with medicines and medical procedures. For more information, go to the Health Topics Thrombocytopenia article.
                
If you have other health problems, such as heart disease or diabetes, work with your doctor to manage them.",treatment,Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome,What are the treatments for Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/hemophilia,"Treatment With Replacement Therapy
                
The main treatment for hemophilia is called replacement therapy. Concentrates of clotting factor VIII (for hemophilia A) or clotting factor IX (for hemophilia B) are slowly dripped or injected into a vein. These infusions help replace the clotting factor that's missing or low.
                
Clotting factor concentrates can be made from human blood. The blood is treated to prevent the spread of diseases, such as hepatitis. With the current methods of screening and treating donated blood, the risk of getting an infectious disease from human clotting factors is very small.
                
To further reduce the risk, you or your child can take clotting factor concentrates that aren't made from human blood. These are called recombinant clotting factors. Clotting factors are easy to store, mix, and use at homeit only takes about 15 minutes to receive the factor.
                
You may have replacement therapy on a regular basis to prevent bleeding. This is called preventive or prophylactic (PRO-fih-lac-tik) therapy. Or, you may only need replacement therapy to stop bleeding when it occurs. This use of the treatment, on an as-needed basis, is called demand therapy.
                
Demand therapy is less intensive and expensive than preventive therapy. However, there's a risk that bleeding will cause damage before you receive the demand therapy.
                
Complications of Replacement Therapy
                
Complications of replacement therapy include:
                
Developing antibodies (proteins) that attack the clotting factor
                
Developing viral infections from human clotting factors
                
Damage to joints, muscles, or other parts of the body resulting from delays in treatment
                
Antibodies to the clotting factor. Antibodies can destroy the clotting factor before it has a chance to work. This is a very serious problem. It prevents the main treatment for hemophilia (replacement therapy) from working.
                
These antibodies, also called inhibitors, develop in about 2030 percent of people who have severe hemophilia A. Inhibitors develop in 25 percent of people who have hemophilia B.
                
When antibodies develop, doctors may use larger doses of clotting factor or try different clotting factor sources. Sometimes the antibodies go away.
                
Researchers are studying new ways to deal with antibodies to clotting factors.
                
Viruses from human clotting factors. Clotting factors made from human blood can carry the viruses that cause HIV/AIDS and hepatitis. However, the risk of getting an infectious disease from human clotting factors is very small due to:
                
Careful screening of blood donors
                
Testing of donated blood products
                
Treating donated blood products with a detergent and heat to destroy viruses
                
Vaccinating people who have hemophilia for hepatitis A and B
                
Damage to joints, muscles, and other parts of the body. Delays in treatment can cause damage such as: 
                
Bleeding into a joint. If this happens many times, it can lead to changes in the shape of the joint and impair the joint's function.
                
Swelling of the membrane around a joint.
                
Pain, swelling, and redness of a joint.
                
Pressure on a joint from swelling, which can destroy the joint.
                
Home Treatment With Replacement Therapy
                
You can do both preventive (ongoing) and demand (as-needed) replacement therapy at home. Many people learn to do the infusions at home for their child or for themselves. Home treatment has several advantages:
                
You or your child can get quicker treatment when bleeding happens. Early treatment lowers the risk of complications.
                
Fewer visits to the doctor or emergency room are needed.
                
Home treatment costs less than treatment in a medical care setting.
                
Home treatment helps children accept treatment and take responsibility for their own health.
                
Discuss options for home treatment with your doctor or your child's doctor. A doctor or other health care provider can teach you the steps and safety procedures for home treatment. Hemophilia treatment centers are another good resource for learning about home treatment (discussed in ""Living With Hemophilia).
                
Doctors can surgically implant vein access devices to make it easier for you to access a vein for treatment with replacement therapy. These devices can be helpful if treatment occurs often. However, infections can be a problem with these devices. Your doctor can help you decide whether this type of device is right for you or your child.
                
Other Types of Treatment
                
Desmopressin
                
Desmopressin (DDAVP) is a man-made hormone used to treat people who have mild hemophilia A. DDAVP isn't used to treat hemophilia B or severe hemophilia A.
                
DDAVP stimulates the release of stored factor VIII and von Willebrand factor; it also increases the level of these proteins in your blood. Von Willebrand factor carries and binds factor VIII, which can then stay in the bloodstream longer.
                
DDAVP usually is given by injection or as nasal spray. Because the effect of this medicine wears off if it's used often, the medicine is given only in certain situations. For example, you may take this medicine prior to dental work or before playing certain sports to prevent or reduce bleeding.
                
Antifibrinolytic Medicines
                
Antifibrinolytic medicines (including tranexamic acid and epsilon aminocaproic acid) may be used with replacement therapy. They're usually given as a pill, and they help keep blood clots from breaking down.
                
These medicines most often are used before dental work or to treat bleeding from the mouth or nose or mild intestinal bleeding.
                
Gene Therapy
                
Researchers are trying to find ways to correct the faulty genes that cause hemophilia. Gene therapy hasn't yet developed to the point that it's an accepted treatment for hemophilia. However, researchers continue to test gene therapy in clinical trials.
                
For more information, go to the ""Clinical Trials"" section of this article.
                
Treatment of a Specific Bleeding Site
                
Pain medicines, steroids, and physical therapy may be used to reduce pain and swelling in an affected joint. Talk with your doctor or pharmacist about which medicines are safe for you to take.
                
Which Treatment Is Best for You?
                
The type of treatment you or your child receives depends on several things, including how severe the hemophilia is, the activities you'll be doing, and the dental or medical procedures you'll be having.
                
Mild hemophiliaReplacement therapy usually isn't needed for mild hemophilia. Sometimes, though, DDAVP is given to raise the body's level of factor VIII.
                
Moderate hemophiliaYou may need replacement therapy only when bleeding occurs or to prevent bleeding that could occur when doing certain activities. Your doctor also may recommend DDAVP prior to having a procedure or doing an activity that increases the risk of bleeding.
                
Severe hemophiliaYou usually need replacement therapy to prevent bleeding that could damage your joints, muscles, or other parts of your body. Typically, replacement therapy is given at home two or three times a week. This preventive therapy usually is started in patients at a young age and may need to continue for life.
                
For both types of hemophilia, getting quick treatment for bleeding is important. Quick treatment can limit damage to your body. If you or your child has hemophilia, learn to recognize signs of bleeding.
                
Other family members also should learn to watch for signs of bleeding in a child who has hemophilia. Children sometimes ignore signs of bleeding because they want to avoid the discomfort of treatment.",treatment,Hemophilia,What are the treatments for Hemophilia ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/cough,"The best way to treat a cough is to treat its cause. However, sometimes the cause is unknown. Other treatments, such as medicines and a vaporizer, can help relieve the cough itself.
                
Treating the Cause of a Cough
                
Acute and Subacute Cough
                
An acute cough lasts less than 3 weeks. Common causes of an acute cough are a common cold or other upper respiratory infections. Examples of other upper respiratory infections include the flu, pneumonia, and whooping cough. An acute cough usually goes away after the illness that caused it is over.
                
A subacute cough lasts 3 to 8 weeks. This type of cough remains even after a cold or other respiratory infection is over.
                
Studies show that antibiotics and cold medicines can't cure a cold. However, your doctor may prescribe medicines to treat another cause of an acute or subacute cough. For example, antibiotics may be given for pneumonia.
                
Chronic Cough
                
A chronic cough lasts more than 8 weeks. Common causes of a chronic cough are upper airway cough syndrome (UACS), asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
                
""UACS"" is a term used to describe conditions that inflame the upper airways and cause a cough. Examples include sinus infections and allergies. These conditions can cause mucus (a slimy substance) to run down your throat from the back of your nose. This is called postnasal drip.
                
If you have a sinus infection, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics. He or she also may suggest you use a medicine that you spray into your nose. If allergies are causing your cough, your doctor may advise you to avoid the substances that you're allergic to (allergens) if possible.
                
If you have asthma, try to avoid irritants and allergens that make your asthma worse. Take your asthma medicines as your doctor prescribes.
                
GERD occurs if acid from your stomach backs up into your throat. Your doctor may prescribe a medicine to reduce acid in your stomach. You also may be able to relieve GERD symptoms by waiting 3 to 4 hours after a meal before lying down, and by sleeping with your head raised.
                
Smoking also can cause a chronic cough. If you smoke, it's important to quit. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke.
                
Many hospitals have programs that help people quit smoking, or hospital staff can refer you to a program. The Health Topics Smoking and Your Heart article and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's ""Your Guide to a Healthy Heart"" booklet have more information about how to quit smoking.
                
Other causes of a chronic cough include respiratory infections, chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, lung cancer, and heart failure. Treatments for these causes may include medicines, procedures, and other therapies. Treatment also may include avoiding irritants and allergens and quitting smoking.
                
If your chronic cough is due to a medicine you're taking, your doctor may prescribe a different medicine.
                
Treating the Cough Rather Than the Cause
                
Coughing is important because it helps clear your airways of irritants, such as smoke and mucus (a slimy substance). Coughing also helps prevent infections.
                
Cough medicines usually are used only when the cause of the cough is unknown and the cough causes a lot of discomfort.
                
Medicines can help control a cough and make it easier to cough up mucus. Your doctor may recommend medicines such as:
                
Prescription cough suppressants, also called antitussives. These medicines can help relieve a cough. However, they're usually used when nothing else works. No evidence shows that over-the-counter cough suppressants relieve a cough.
                
Expectorants. These medicines may loosen mucus, making it easier to cough up.
                
Bronchodilators. These medicines relax your airways.
                
Other treatments also may relieve an irritated throat and loosen mucus. Examples include using a cool-mist humidifier or steam vaporizer and drinking enough fluids. Examples of fluids are water, soup, and juice. Ask your doctor how much fluid you need.
                
Cough in Children
                
No evidence shows that cough and cold medicines help children recover more quickly from colds. These medicines can even harm children. Talk with your child's doctor about your child's cough and how to treat it.",treatment,Cough,What are the treatments for Cough ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/hpl,"Treatment for palpitations depends on their cause. Most palpitations are harmless and often go away on their own. In these cases, no treatment is needed.
                
Avoiding Triggers
                
Your palpitations may be harmless but bothersome. If so, your doctor may suggest avoiding things that trigger them. For examples, your doctor may advise you to:
                
Reduce anxiety and stress. Anxiety and stress (including panic attacks) are a common cause of harmless palpitations. Relaxation exercises, yoga or tai chi, biofeedback or guided imagery, or aromatherapy may help you relax.
                
Avoid or limit stimulants, such as caffeine, nicotine, or alcohol.
                
Avoid illegal drugs, such as cocaine and amphetamines.
                
Avoid medicines that act as stimulants, such as cough and cold medicines and some herbal and nutritional supplements.
                
Treating Medical Conditions That May Cause Palpitations
                
Work with your doctor to control medical conditions that can cause palpitations, such as an overactive thyroid. If you're taking medicine that's causing palpitations, your doctor will try to find a different medicine for you.

Reduce anxiety and stress. Anxiety and stress (including panic attacks) are a common cause of harmless palpitations. Relaxation exercises, yoga or tai chi, biofeedback or guided imagery, or aromatherapy may help you relax.
                
Avoid or limit stimulants, such as caffeine, nicotine, or alcohol.
                
Avoid illegal drugs, such as cocaine and amphetamines.
                
Avoid medicines that act as stimulants, such as cough and cold medicines and some herbal and nutritional supplements.

NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/angina,"Treatments for angina include lifestyle changes, medicines, medical procedures, cardiac rehabilitation (rehab), and other therapies. The main goals of treatment are to:
                
Reduce pain and discomfort and how often it occurs
                
Prevent or lower your risk for heart attack and death by treating your underlying heart condition
                
Lifestyle changes and medicines may be the only treatments needed if your symptoms are mild and aren't getting worse. If lifestyle changes and medicines don't control angina, you may need medical procedures or cardiac rehab.
                
Unstable angina is an emergency condition that requires treatment in a hospital.
                
Lifestyle Changes
                
Making lifestyle changes can help prevent episodes of angina. You can:
                
Slow down or take rest breaks if physical exertion triggers angina.
                
Avoid large meals and rich foods that leave you feeling stuffed if heavy meals trigger angina.
                
Try to avoid situations that make you upset or stressed if emotional stress triggers angina. Learn ways to handle stress that can't be avoided.
                
You also can make lifestyle changes that help lower your risk for coronary heart disease. One of the most important changes is to quit smoking. Smoking can damage and tighten blood vessels and raise your risk for CHD. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke.
                
If you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking.
                
For more information about how to quit smoking, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index (DCI) Smoking and Your Heart article and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes (NHLBIs) ""Your Guide to a Healthy Heart.""
                
Following a healthy diet is another important lifestyle change. A healthy diet can prevent or reduce high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol and help you maintain a healthy weight.
                
A healthy diet includes a variety of fruits and vegetables (including beans and peas). It also includes whole grains, lean meats, poultry without skin, seafood, and fat-free or low-fat milk and dairy products. A healthy diet also is low in sodium (salt), added sugars, solid fats, and refined grains.
                
For more information about following a healthy diet, go to the NHLBIs Your Guide to Lowering Your Blood Pressure With DASH and the U.S. Department of Agricultures ChooseMyPlate.gov Web site. Both resources provide general information about healthy eating.
                
Other important lifestyle changes include:
                
Being physically active. Check with your doctor to find out how much and what kinds of activity are safe for you. For more information, go to the DCI Physical Activity and Your Heart article.
                
Maintaining a healthy weight. If youre overweight or obese, work with your doctor to create a reasonable weight-loss plan. Controlling your weight helps you control CHD risk factors.
                
Taking all medicines as your doctor prescribes, especially if you have diabetes.
                
Medicines
                
Nitrates are the medicines most commonly used to treat angina. They relax and widen blood vessels. This allows more blood to flow to the heart, while reducing the hearts workload.
                
Nitroglycerin (NI-tro-GLIS-er-in) is the most commonly used nitrate for angina. Nitroglycerin that dissolves under your tongue or between your cheek and gum is used to relieve angina episodes.
                
Nitroglycerin pills and skin patches are used to prevent angina episodes. However, pills and skin patches act too slowly to relieve pain during an angina attack.
                
Other medicines also are used to treat angina, such as beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, oral antiplatelet medicines, or anticoagulants (blood thinners). These medicines can help:
                
Lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels
                
Slow the heart rate
                
Relax blood vessels
                
Reduce strain on the heart
                
Prevent blood clots from forming
                
People who have stable angina may be advised to get annual flu shots.
                
Medical Procedures
                
If lifestyle changes and medicines don't control angina, you may need a medical procedure to treat the underlying heart disease. Both angioplasty (AN-jee-oh-plas-tee) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) are commonly used to treat heart disease.
                
Angioplasty opens blocked or narrowed coronary arteries. During angioplasty, a thin tube with a balloon or other device on the end is threaded through a blood vessel to the narrowed or blocked coronary artery.
                
Once in place, the balloon is inflated to push the plaque outward against the wall of the artery. This widens the artery and restores blood flow.
                
Angioplasty can improve blood flow to your heart and relieve chest pain. A small mesh tube called a stent usually is placed in the artery to help keep it open after the procedure.
                
During CABG, healthy arteries or veins taken from other areas in your body are used to bypass (that is, go around) your narrowed coronary arteries. Bypass surgery can improve blood flow to your heart, relieve chest pain, and possibly prevent a heart attack.
                
You will work with your doctor to decide which treatment is better for you.
                
Cardiac Rehabilitation
                
Your doctor may recommend cardiac rehab for angina or after angioplasty, CABG, or a heart attack. Cardiac rehab is a medically supervised program that can help improve the health and well-being of people who have heart problems.
                
The cardiac rehab team may include doctors, nurses, exercise specialists, physical and occupational therapists, dietitians or nutritionists, and psychologists or other mental health specialists.
                
Rehab has two parts:
                
Exercise training. This part helps you learn how to exercise safely, strengthen your muscles, and improve your stamina. Your exercise plan will be based on your personal abilities, needs, and interests.
                
Education, counseling, and training. This part of rehab helps you understand your heart condition and find ways to reduce your risk for future heart problems. The rehab team will help you learn how to adjust to a new lifestyle and deal with your fears about the future.
                
For more information about cardiac rehab, go to the DCI Cardiac Rehabilitation article.
                
Enhanced External Counterpulsation Therapy
                
Enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP) therapy is helpful for some people who have angina. Large cuffs, similar to blood pressure cuffs, are put on your legs. The cuffs are inflated and deflated in sync with your heartbeat.
                
EECP therapy improves the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your heart muscle and helps relieve angina. You typically get 35 1-hour treatments over 7 weeks.",treatment,Angina,What are the treatments for Angina ?,Drugs

NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/mvp,"Most people who have mitral valve prolapse (MVP) dont need treatment because they dont have symptoms and complications.
                
Even people who do have symptoms may not need treatment. The presence of symptoms doesnt always mean that the backflow of blood through the valve is significant.
                
People who have MVP and troublesome mitral valve backflow may be treated with medicines, surgery, or both.
                
The goals of treating MVP include:
                
Correcting the underlying mitral valve problem, if necessary
                
Preventinginfective endocarditis,arrhythmias, and other complications
                
Relieving symptoms
                
Medicines
                
Medicines called beta blockers may be used to treatpalpitationsand chest discomfort in people who have little or no mitral valve backflow.
                
If you have significant backflow and symptoms, your doctor may prescribe:
                
Blood-thinning medicines to reduce the risk of blood clots forming if you haveatrial fibrillation.
                
Digoxin to strengthen your heartbeat.
                
Diuretics (fluidpills) to remove excess sodium and fluid in your body and lungs.
                
Medicines such as flecainide and procainamide to regulate your heart rhythms.
                
Vasodilators to widen your blood vessels and reduce your hearts workload. Examples of vasodilators are isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine.
                
Take all medicines regularly, as your doctor prescribes. Dont change the amount of your medicine or skip a dose unless your doctor tells you to.
                
Surgery
                
Surgery is done only if the mitral valve is very abnormal and blood is flowing back into the atrium. The main goal of surgery is to improve symptoms and reduce the risk ofheart failure.
                
The timing of the surgery is important. If its done too early and your leaking valve is working fairly well, you may be put at needless risk from surgery. If its done too late, you may have heart damage that can't be fixed.
                
Surgical Approaches
                
Traditionally, heart surgeons repair or replace a mitral valve by making an incision (cut) in the breastbone and exposing the heart.
                
A small but growing number of surgeons are using another approach that involves one or more small cuts through the side of the chest wall. This results in less cutting, reduced blood loss, and a shorter hospital stay. However, not all hospitals offer this method.
                
Valve Repair and Valve Replacement
                
In mitral valve surgery, the valve is repaired or replaced. Valve repair is preferred when possible. Repair is less likely than replacement to weaken the heart. Repair also lowers the risk of infection and decreases the need for lifelong use of blood-thinning medicines.
                
If repair isnt an option, the valve can be replaced. Mechanical and biological valves are used as replacement valves.
                
Mechanical valves are man-made and can last a lifetime. People who have mechanical valves must take blood-thinning medicines for the rest of their lives.
                
Biological valves are taken from cows or pigs or made from human tissue. Many people who have biological valves dont need to take blood-thinning medicines for the rest of their lives. The major drawback of biological valves is that they weaken over time and often last only about 10 years.
                
After surgery, youll likely stay in the hospitals intensive care unit for 2 to 3 days. Overall, most people who have mitral valve surgery spend about 1 to 2 weeks in the hospital. Complete recovery takes a few weeks to several months, depending on your health before surgery.
                
If youve had valve repair or replacement, you may need antibiotics before dental work and surgery. These procedures can allow bacteria to enter your bloodstream. Antibiotics can help prevent infective endocarditis, a serious heart valve infection. Discuss with your doctor whether you need to take antibiotics before such procedures.
                
Transcatheter Valve Therapy
                
Interventional cardiologists may be able to repair leaky mitral valves by implanting a device using a catheter (tube) inserted through a large blood vessel. This approach is less invasive and can prevent a person from havingopen-heart surgery. At present, the device is only approved for people with severe mitral regurgitation who cannot undergo surgery.",treatment,Mitral Valve Prolapse,What are the treatments for Mitral Valve Prolapse ?,Drugs

NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/tof,"Tetralogy of Fallot is repaired with open-heart surgery, either soon after birth or later in infancy. The goal of surgery is to repair the four defects of tetralogy of Fallot so the heart can work as normally as possible. Repairing the defects can greatly improve a child's health and quality of life.
                
The pediatric cardiologist and cardiac surgeon will decide the best time to do the surgery. They will base their decision on your baby's health and weight and the severity of the defects and symptoms.
                
Some teenagers or adults who had tetralogy of Fallot repaired in childhood need additional surgery to correct heart problems that develop over time. For more information, go to ""Living With Tetralogy of Fallot.""
                
Types of Surgery
                
Complete Intracardiac Repair
                
Surgery to repair tetralogy of Fallot improves blood flow to the lungs. Surgery also ensures that oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood flow to the right places.
                
The surgeon will:
                
Widen the narrowed pulmonary blood vessels. The pulmonary valve is widened or replaced. Also, the passage from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery is enlarged. These procedures improve blood flow to the lungs. This allows the blood to get enough oxygen to meet the body's needs.
                
Repair the ventricular septal defect (VSD). A patch is used to cover the hole in the septum. This patch stops oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood from mixing between the ventricles.
                
Fixing these two defects resolves problems caused by the other two defects. When the right ventricle no longer has to work so hard to pump blood to the lungs, it will return to a normal thickness. Fixing the VSD means that only oxygen-rich blood will flow out of the left ventricle into the aorta.
                
The incision (cut) that the surgeon makes to reach the heart usually heals in about 6weeks. The surgeon or a hospital staff member will explain when it's okay to give your baby a bath, pick him or her up under the arms, and take your baby for regular shots (immunizations).
                
Temporary or Palliative Surgery
                
It was common in the past to do temporary surgery during infancy for tetralogy of Fallot. This surgery improved blood flow to the lungs. A complete repair of the four defects was done later in childhood.
                
Now, tetralogy of Fallot usually is fully repaired in infancy. However, some babies are too weak or too small to have the full repair. They must have temporary surgery first. This surgery improves oxygen levels in the blood. The surgery also gives the baby time to grow and get strong enough for the full repair.
                
For temporary surgery, the surgeon places a tube between a large artery branching off the aorta and the pulmonary artery. The tube is called a shunt. One end of the shunt is sewn to the artery branching off the aorta. The other end is sewn to the pulmonary artery.
                
The shunt creates an additional pathway for blood to travel to the lungs to get oxygen. The surgeon removes the shunt when the baby's heart defects are fixed during the full repair.
                
After temporary surgery, your baby may need medicines to keep the shunt open while waiting for the full repair. These medicines are stopped after the surgeon removes the shunt.",treatment,Tetralogy of Fallot,What are the treatments for Tetralogy of Fallot ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/chd,"Although many children who have congenital heart defects don't need treatment, some do. Doctors repair congenital heart defects with catheter procedures or surgery.
                
Sometimes doctors combine catheter and surgical procedures to repair complex heart defects, which may involve several kinds of defects.
                
The treatment your child receives depends on the type and severity of his or her heart defect. Other factors include your child's age, size, and general health.
                
Some children who have complex congenital heart defects may need several catheter or surgical procedures over a period of years, or they may need to take medicines for years.
                
Catheter Procedures
                
Catheter procedures are much easier on patients than surgery. They involve only a needle puncture in the skin where the catheter (thin, flexible tube) is inserted into a vein or an artery.
                
Doctors don't have to surgically open the chest or operate directly on the heart to repair the defect(s). This means that recovery may be easier and quicker.
                
The use of catheter procedures has increased a lot in the past 20 years. They have become the preferred way to repair many simple heart defects, such as atrial septal defect (ASD) and pulmonary valve stenosis.
                
For ASD repair, the doctor inserts a catheter into a vein in the groin (upper thigh). He or she threads the tube to the heart's septum. A device made up of two small disks or an umbrella-like device is attached to the catheter.
                
When the catheter reaches the septum, the device is pushed out of the catheter. The device is placed so that it plugs the hole between the atria. Its secured in place and the catheter is withdrawn from the body.
                
Within 6 months, normal tissue grows in and over the device. The closure device does not need to be replaced as the child grows.
                
For pulmonary valve stenosis, the doctor inserts a catheter into a vein and threads it to the hearts pulmonary valve. A tiny balloon at the end of the catheter is quickly inflated to push apart the leaflets, or ""doors,"" of the valve.
                
Then, the balloon is deflated and the catheter and ballon are withdrawn. This procedure can be used to repair any narrowed valve in the heart.
                
To help guide the catheter, doctors often use echocardiography (echo), transesophageal (tranz-ih-sof-uh-JEE-ul) echo (TEE), and coronary angiography (an-jee-OG-rah-fee).
                
TEE is a special type of echo that takes pictures of the heart through the esophagus. The esophagus is the passage leading from the mouth to the stomach. Doctors also use TEE to examine complex heart defects.
                
Surgery
                
A child may need open-heart surgery if his or her heart defect can't be fixed using a catheter procedure. Sometimes one surgery can repair the defect completely. If that's not possible, the child may need more surgeries over months or years to fix the problem.
                
Cardiac surgeons may use open-heart surgery to:
                
Close holes in the heart with stitches or a patch
                
Repair or replace heart valves
                
Widen arteries or openings to heart valves
                
Repair complex defects, such as problems with the location of blood vessels near the heart or how they are formed
                
Rarely, babies are born with multiple defects that are too complex to repair. These babies may need heart transplants. In this procedure, the child's heart is replaced with a healthy heart from a deceased child. The heart has been donated by the deceased childs family.",treatment,Congenital Heart Defects,What are the treatments for Congenital Heart Defects ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/broken-heart-syndrome,"Even though broken heart syndrome may feel like a heart attack, its a very different problem that needs a different type of treatment.
                
The good news is that broken heart syndrome is usually treatable, and most people make a full recovery. Most people who experience broken heart syndrome stay in the hospital for a few days to a week.
                
Initial treatment is aimed at improving blood flow to the heart, and may be similar to that for a heart attack until the diagnosis is clear. Further treatment can include medicines and lifestyle changes.
                
Medicines
                
Doctors may prescribe medicines to relieve fluid buildup, treat blood pressure problems, prevent blood clots, and manage stress hormones. Medicines are often discontinued once heart function has returned to normal.
                
Your doctor may prescribe the following medicines:
                
ACE inhibitors (or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors), to lower blood pressure and reduce strain on your heart
                
Beta blockers, to slow your heart rate and lower your blood pressure to decrease your hearts workload
                
Diuretics (water or fluid pills), to help reduce fluid buildup in your lungs and swelling in your feet and ankles
                
Anti-anxiety medicines, to help manage stress hormones
                
Take all of your medicines as prescribed. If you have side effects or other problems related to your medicines, tell your doctor. He or she may be able to provide other options.
                
Treatment of Complications
                
Broken heart syndrome can be life threatening in some cases. Because the syndrome involves severe heart muscle weakness, patients can experience shock, heart failure, low blood pressure, and potentially life-threatening heart rhythm abnormalities.
                
The good news is that this condition improves very quickly, so with proper diagnosis and management, even the most critically ill tend to make a quick and complete recovery.
                
Lifestyle Changes

The goals of treating hemolytic anemia include:
                
Reducing or stopping the destruction of red blood cells
                
Increasing the red blood cell count to an acceptable level
                
Treating the underlying cause of the condition
                
Treatment will depend on the type, cause, and severity of the hemolytic anemia you have. Your doctor also will consider your age, overall health, and medical history.
                
If you have an inherited form of hemolytic anemia, it's a lifelong condition that may require ongoing treatment. If you have an acquired form of hemolytic anemia, it may go away if its cause can be found and corrected.
                
Blood Transfusions
                
Blood transfusions are used to treat severe or life-threatening hemolytic anemia.
                
A blood transfusion is a common procedure in which blood is given to you through an intravenous (IV) line in one of your blood vessels. Transfusions require careful matching of donated blood with the recipient's blood.
                
For more information, go to the Health Topics Blood Transfusion article.
                
Medicines
                
Medicines can improve some types of hemolytic anemia, especially autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). Corticosteroid medicines, such as prednisone, can stop your immune system from, or limit its ability to, make antibodies (proteins) against red blood cells.
                
If you don't respond to corticosteroids, your doctor may prescribe other medicines to suppress your immune system. Examples include the medicines rituximab and cyclosporine.
                
If you have severe sickle cell anemia, your doctor may recommend a medicine called hydroxyurea. This medicine prompts your body to make fetal hemoglobin. Fetal hemoglobin is the type of hemoglobin that newborns have.
                
In people who have sickle cell anemia, fetal hemoglobin helps prevent red blood cells from sickling and improves anemia.
                
Plasmapheresis
                
Plasmapheresis is a procedure that removes antibodies from the blood. For this procedure, blood is taken from your body using a needle inserted into a vein.
                
The plasma, which contains the antibodies, is separated from the rest of the blood. Then, plasma from a donor and the rest of the blood is put back in your body.
                
This treatment may help if other treatments for immune hemolytic anemia don't work.
                
Surgery
                
Some people who have hemolytic anemia may need surgery to remove their spleens. The spleen is an organ in the abdomen. A healthy spleen helps fight infection and filters out old or damaged blood cells.
                
An enlarged or diseased spleen may remove more red blood cells than normal, causing anemia. Removing the spleen can stop or reduce high rates of red blood cell destruction.
                
Blood and Marrow Stem Cell Transplant
                
In some types of hemolytic anemia, such as thalassemias, the bone marrow doesn't make enough healthy red blood cells. The red blood cells it does make may be destroyed before their normal lifespan is over. Blood and marrow stem cell transplants may be used to treat these types of hemolytic anemia.
                
A blood and marrow stem cell transplant replaces damaged stem cells with healthy ones from another person (a donor).
                
During the transplant, which is like a blood transfusion, you get donated stem cells through a tube placed in a vein. Once the stem cells are in your body, they travel to your bone marrow and begin making new blood cells.
                
For more information, go to the Health Topics Blood and Marrow Stem Cell Transplant article.
                
Lifestyle Changes
                
If you have AIHA with cold-reactive antibodies, try to avoid cold temperatures. This can help prevent the breakdown of red blood cells. It's very important to protect your fingers, toes, and ears from the cold.
                
To protect yourself, you can:
                
Wear gloves or mittens when taking food out of the refrigerator or freezer.
                
Wear a hat, scarf, and a coat with snug cuffs during cold weather.
                
Turn down air conditioning or dress warmly while in air-conditioned spaces.
                
Warm up the car before driving in cold weather.
                
People born with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency can avoid substances that may trigger anemia. For example, avoid fava beans, naphthalene (a substance found in some moth balls), and certain medicines (as your doctor advises).",treatment,Hemolytic Anemia,What are the treatments for Hemolytic Anemia ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/ha,"You can't prevent inherited types of hemolytic anemia. One exception is glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency.

Some types of acquired hemolytic anemia can be prevented. For example, reactions to blood transfusions, which can cause hemolytic anemia, can be prevented. This requires careful matching of blood types between the blood donor and the recipient.
                
Prompt and proper prenatal care can help you avoid the problems of Rh incompatibility. This condition can occur during pregnancy if a woman has Rh-negative blood and her baby has Rh-positive blood. ""Rh-negative"" and ""Rh-positive"" refer to whether your blood has Rh factor. Rh factor is a protein on red blood cells.

NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/mar,"Marfan syndrome has no cure. However, treatments can help delay or prevent complications, especially when started early.
                
Marfan syndrome can affect many parts of your body, including your heart, bones and joints, eyes, nervous system, and lungs. The type of treatment you receive will depend on your signs and symptoms.
                
Heart Treatments
                
Aortic dilation, or aortic aneurysm, is the most common and serious heart problem linked to Marfan syndrome. In this condition, the aortathe main artery that carries oxygen-rich blood to your bodystretches and grows weak.
                
Medicines are used to try to slow the rate of aortic dilation. Surgery is used to replace the dilated segment of aorta before it tears.
                
If you have Marfan syndrome, you'll need routine care and tests to check your heart valves and aorta.
                
Medicines
                
Beta blockers are medicines that help your heart beat slower and with less force. These medicines may help relieve strain on your aorta and slow the rate of aortic dilation.
                
Some people have side effects from beta blockers, such as tiredness and nausea (feeling sick to your stomach). If side effects occur, your doctor may prescribe a calcium channel blocker or ACE inhibitor instead of a beta blocker. Both medicines help relieve stress on the aorta.
                
Studies suggest that blocking a protein called TGF-beta may help prevent some of the effects of Marfan syndrome. Research shows that the medicine losartan may block the protein in other conditions.
                
The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute currently is sponsoring a study comparing losartan to a beta blocker in children and adults who have Marfan syndrome. The study's goal is to find out which medicine, if either, is best at slowing the rate of aortic dilation.
                
Surgery
                
If your aorta stretches, it's more likely to tear (a condition called aortic dissection). To prevent this, your doctor may recommend surgery to repair or replace part of your aorta.
                
Surgery may involve:
                
A composite valve graft. For this surgery, part of the aorta and the aortic valve are removed. The aorta is replaced with a man-made tube called a graft. A man-made valve replaces the original valve.
                
Aortic valve-sparing surgery. If your aortic valve is working well, your doctor may recommend valve-sparing surgery. For this surgery, your doctor replaces the enlarged part of your aorta with a graft. Your aortic valve is left in place.
                
After aortic surgery, you may need medicines or followup tests. For example, after a composite valve graft, your doctor will prescribe medicines called anticoagulants, or ""blood thinners.""
                
Blood thinners help prevent blood clots from forming on your man-made aortic valve. You'll need to take these medicines for the rest of your life. If you've had valve-sparing surgery, you'll only need to take blood thinners for a short time, as your doctor prescribes.
                
If you've had a composite valve graft, you're at increased risk for endocarditis (EN-do-kar-DI-tis). This is an infection of the inner lining of your heart chambers and valves. Your doctor may recommend that you take antibiotics before certain medical or dental procedures that increase your risk of endocarditis.
                
Your doctor also may advise you to continue taking beta blockers or other medicines after either type of aortic surgery.
                
After surgery, you may have routine cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or cardiac computed tomography (CT) scans to check your aorta.
                
Cardiac MRI is a painless test that uses radio waves and magnets to created detailed pictures of your organs and tissues. Cardiac CT is a painless test that uses an x-ray machine to take clear, detailed pictures of your heart.
                
Bone and Joint Treatments
                
If you have scoliosis (a curved spine), your doctor may suggest a brace or other device to prevent the condition from getting worse. Severe cases of scoliosis may require surgery.
                
Some people who have Marfan syndrome need surgery to repair a chest that sinks in or sticks out. This surgery is done to prevent the chest from pressing on the lungs and heart.
                
Eye Treatments
                
Marfan syndrome can lead to many eye problems, such as a dislocated lens, nearsightedness, early glaucoma (high pressure in the fluid in the eyes), and cataracts (clouding of an eye's lens).
                
Glasses or contact lenses can help with some of these problems. Sometimes surgery is needed.
                
Nervous System Treatments
                
Marfan syndrome can lead to dural ectasia. In this condition, a substance called the dura (which covers the fluid around your brain and spinal cord) stretches and grows weak. This can cause the bones of the spine to wear away. Dural ectasia usually is treated with pain medicines.
                
Lung Treatments
                
Marfan syndrome may cause pneumothorax, or collapsed lung. In this condition, air or gas builds up in the space between the lungs and the chest wall.
                
If the condition is minor, it may go away on its own. However, you may need to have a tube placed through your skin and chest wall to remove the air. Sometimes surgery is needed.",treatment,Marfan Syndrome,What are the treatments for Marfan Syndrome ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/sarc,"Not everyone who has sarcoidosis needs treatment. Sometimes the disease goes away on its own. Whether you need treatment and what type of treatment you need depend on your signs and symptoms, which organs are affected, and whether those organs are working well.
                
If the disease affects certain organssuch as your eyes, heart, or brainyou'll need treatment even if you don't have any symptoms.
                
In either case, whether you have symptoms or not, you should see your doctor for ongoing care. He or she will want to check to make sure that the disease isn't damaging your organs. For example, you may need routine lung function tests to make sure that your lungs are working well.
                
If the disease isn't worsening, your doctor may watch you closely to see whether the disease goes away on its own. If the disease does start to get worse, your doctor can prescribe treatment.
                
The goals of treatment include:
                
Relieving symptoms
                
Improving organ function
                
Controlling inflammation and reducing the size of granulomas (inflamed lumps)
                
Preventing pulmonary fibrosis (lung scarring) if your lungs are affected
                
Your doctor may prescribe topical treatments and/or medicines to treat the disease.
                
Medicines
                
Prednisone
                
Prednisone, a type of steroid, is the main treatment for sarcoidosis. This medicine reduces inflammation. In most people, prednisone relieves symptoms within a couple of months.
                
Although most people need to take prednisone for 12 months or longer, your doctor may lower the dose within a few months after you start the medicine.
                
Long-term use of prednisone, especially at high doses, can cause serious side effects. Work with your doctor to decide whether the benefits of this medicine outweigh the risks. If your doctor prescribes this treatment, he or she will find the lowest dose that controls your disease.
                
When you stop taking prednisone, you should cut back slowly (as your doctor advises). This will help prevent flareups of sarcoidosis. Cutting back slowly also allows your body to adjust to not having the medicine.
                
If a relapse or flareup occurs after you stop taking prednisone, you may need a second round of treatment. If you remain stable for more than 1 year after stopping this treatment, the risk of relapse is low.
                
Other Medicines
                
Other medicines, besides prednisone, also are used to treat sarcoidosis. Examples include:
                
Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine (known as antimalarial medicines). These medicines work best for treating sarcoidosis that affects the skin or brain. Your doctor also may prescribe an antimalarial if you have a high level of calcium in your blood due to sarcoidosis.
                
Medicines that suppress the immune system, such as methotrexate, azathioprine, or leflunomide. These medicines work best for treating sarcoidosis that affects your lungs, eyes, skin, or joints.
                
Your doctor may prescribe these medicines if your sarcoidosis worsens while you're taking prednisone or if you can't handle prednisone's side effects.
                
If you have Lofgren's syndrome with pain or fever, your doctor may prescribe nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen.
                
If you're wheezing and coughing, you may need inhaled medicine to help open your airways. You take inhaled medicine using an inhaler. This device allows the medicine to go straight to your lungs.
                
Anti-tumor necrosis factor drugs, originally developed to treat arthritis, are being studied to treat sarcoidosis.
                
Ongoing Research
                
Researchers continue to look for new and better treatments for sarcoidosis. They're currently studying treatments aimed at the immune system. Researchers also are studying antibiotics as a possible treatment for sarcoidosis that affects the skin.

NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/thcp,"Treatment for thrombocytopenia depends on its cause and severity. The main goal of treatment is to prevent death and disability caused by bleeding.
                
If your condition is mild, you may not need treatment. A fully normal platelet count isn't necessary to prevent bleeding, even with severe cuts or accidents.
                
Thrombocytopenia often improves when its underlying cause is treated. People who inherit the condition usually don't need treatment.
                
If a reaction to a medicine is causing a low platelet count, your doctor may prescribe another medicine. Most people recover after the initial medicine has been stopped. For heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), stopping the heparin isn't enough. Often, you'll need another medicine to prevent blood clotting.
                
If your immune system is causing a low platelet count, your doctor may prescribe medicines to suppress the immune system.
                
Severe Thrombocytopenia
                
If your thrombocytopenia is severe, your doctor may prescribe treatments such as medicines, blood or platelet transfusions, or splenectomy.
                
Medicines
                
Your doctor may prescribe corticosteroids, also called steroids for short. Steroids may slow platelet destruction. These medicines can be given through a vein or by mouth. One example of this type of medicine is prednisone.
                
The steroids used to treat thrombocytopenia are different from illegal steroids taken by some athletes to enhance performance.
                
Your doctor may prescribe immunoglobulins or medicines like rituximab to block your immune system. These medicines are given through a vein. He or she also may prescribe other medicines, such as eltrombopag or romiplostim, to help your body make more platelets. The former comes as a tablet to take by mouth and the latter is given as an injection under the skin.
                
Blood or Platelet Transfusions
                
Blood or platelet transfusions are used to treat people who have active bleeding or are at a high risk of bleeding. During this procedure, a needle is used to insert an intravenous (IV) line into one of your blood vessels. Through this line, you receive healthy blood or platelets.
                
For more information about this procedure, go to the Health Topics Blood Transfusion article.
                
Splenectomy
                
A splenectomy is surgery to remove the spleen. This surgery may be used if treatment with medicines doesn't work. This surgery mostly is used for adults who have immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). However, medicines often are the first course of treatment.",treatment,Thrombocytopenia,What are the treatments for Thrombocytopenia ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/thcp,"Whether you can prevent thrombocytopenia depends on its specific cause. Usually the condition can't be prevented. However, you can take steps to prevent health problems associated with thrombocytopenia. For example:
                
Avoid heavy drinking. Alcohol slows the production of platelets.
                
Try to avoid contact with toxic chemicals. Chemicals such as pesticides, arsenic, and benzene can slow the production of platelets.
                
Avoid medicines that you know have decreased your platelet count in the past.
                
Be aware of medicines that may affect your platelets and raise your risk of bleeding. Two examples of such medicines are aspirin and ibuprofen. These medicines may thin your blood too much.
                
Talk with your doctor about getting vaccinated for viruses that can affect your platelets. You may need vaccines for mumps, measles, rubella, and chickenpox.

NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/arm,"Aortic aneurysms are treated with medicines and surgery. Small aneurysms that are found early and arent causing symptoms may not need treatment. Other aneurysms need to be treated.
                
The goals of treatment may include:
                
Preventing the aneurysm from growing
                
Preventing or reversing damage to other body structures
                
Preventing or treating a rupture or dissection
                
Allowing you to continue doing your normal daily activities
                
Treatment for an aortic aneurysm is based on its size. Your doctor may recommend routine testing to make sure an aneurysm isn't getting bigger. This method usually is used for aneurysms that are smaller than 5 centimeters (about 2 inches) across.
                
How often you need testing (for example, every few months or every year) is based on the size of the aneurysm and how fast it's growing. The larger it is and the faster it's growing, the more often you may need to be checked.
                
Medicines
                
If you have an aortic aneurysm, your doctor may prescribe medicines before surgery or instead of surgery. Medicines are used to lower blood pressure, relax blood vessels, and lower the risk that the aneurysm will rupture (burst). Beta blockers and calcium channel blockers are the medicines most commonly used.
                
Surgery
                
Your doctor may recommend surgery if your aneurysm is growing quickly or is at risk of rupture or dissection.
                
The two main types of surgery to repair aortic aneurysms are open abdominal or open chest repair and endovascular repair.
                
Open Abdominal or Open Chest Repair
                
The standard and most common type of surgery for aortic aneurysms is open abdominal or open chest repair. This surgery involves a major incision (cut) in the abdomen or chest.
                
General anesthesia (AN-es-THE-ze-ah) is used during this procedure. The term anesthesia refers to a loss of feeling and awareness. General anesthesia temporarily puts you to sleep.
                
During the surgery, the aneurysm is removed. Then, the section of aorta is replaced with a graft made of material such as Dacron or Teflon. The surgery takes 3 to 6 hours; youll remain in the hospital for 5 to 8 days.
                
If needed, repair of the aortic heart valve also may be done during open abdominal or open chest surgery.
                
It often takes a month to recover from open abdominal or open chest surgery and return to full activity. Most patients make a full recovery.
                
Endovascular Repair
                
In endovascular repair, the aneurysm isn't removed. Instead, a graft is inserted into the aorta to strengthen it. Surgeons do this type of surgery using catheters (tubes) inserted into the arteries; it doesn't require surgically opening the chest or abdomen. General anesthesia is used during this procedure.
                
The surgeon first inserts a catheter into an artery in the groin (upper thigh) and threads it to the aneurysm. Then, using an x ray to see the artery, the surgeon threads the graft (also called a stent graft) into the aorta to the aneurysm.
                
The graft is then expanded inside the aorta and fastened in place to form a stable channel for blood flow. The graft reinforces the weakened section of the aorta. This helps prevent the aneurysm from rupturing.
                
Endovascular Repair
                

                
The illustration shows the placement of a stent graft in an aortic aneurysm. In figure A, a catheter is inserted into an artery in the groin (upper thigh). The catheter is threaded to the abdominal aorta, and the stent graft is released from the catheter. In figure B, the stent graft allows blood to flow through the aneurysm.
                
The recovery time for endovascular repair is less than the recovery time for open abdominal or open chest repair. However, doctors cant repair all aortic aneurysms with endovascular repair. The location or size of an aneurysm may prevent the use of a stent graft.",treatment,Aneurysm,What are the treatments for Aneurysm ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/arm,"The best way to prevent an aortic aneurysm is to avoid the factors that put you at higher risk for one. You cant control all aortic aneurysm risk factors, but lifestyle changes can help you lower some risks.
                
For example, if you smoke, try to quit. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke. For more information about how to quit smoking, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index (DCI) Smoking and Your Heart article.
                
Another important lifestyle change is following a healthy diet. A healthy diet includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. It also includes lean meats, poultry, fish, beans, and fat-free or low-fat milk or milk products. A healthy diet is low in saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium (salt), and added sugar.
                
For more information about following a healthy diet, go to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes (NHLBIs) Aim for a Healthy Weight Web site, ""Your Guide to a Healthy Heart,"" and ""Your Guide to Lowering Your Blood Pressure With DASH."" All of these resources include general information about healthy eating.
                
Be as physically active as you can. Talk with your doctor about the amounts and types of physical activity that are safe for you. For more information about physical activity, go to the DCI Physical Activity and Your Heart article and the NHLBIs ""Your Guide to Physical Activity and Your Heart.""
                
Work with your doctor to control medical conditions such as high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol. Follow your treatment plans and take all of your medicines as your doctor prescribes.
                
Screening for Aneurysms
                
Although you may not be able to prevent an aneurysm, early diagnosis and treatment can help prevent rupture and dissection.
                
Aneurysms can develop and grow large before causing any signs or symptoms. Thus, people who are at high risk for aneurysms may benefit from early, routine screening.
                
Your doctor may recommend routine screening if youre:
                
A man between the ages of 65 and 75 who has ever smoked
                
A man or woman between the ages of 65 and 75 who has a family history of aneurysms

Restore regular breathing during sleep
                
Relieve symptoms such as loud snoring and daytime sleepiness
                
Treatment may improve other medical problems linked to sleep apnea, such as high blood pressure. Treatment also can reduce your risk for heart disease,stroke, and diabetes.
                
If you have sleep apnea, talk with your doctor or sleep specialist about the treatment options that will work best for you.
                
Lifestyle changes and/or mouthpieces may relieve mild sleep apnea. People who have moderate or severe sleep apnea may need breathing devices or surgery.
                
If you continue to have daytime sleepiness despite treatment, your doctor may ask whether you're getting enough sleep. (Adults should get at least 7 to 8 hours of sleep; children and teens need more. For more information, go to the Health Topics Sleep Deprivation and Deficiency article.)
                
If treatment and enough sleep don't relieve your daytime sleepiness, your doctor will consider other treatment options.
                
Lifestyle Changes
                
If you have mild sleep apnea, some changes in daily activities or habits might be all the treatment you need.
                
Avoid alcohol and medicines that make you sleepy. They make it harder for your throat to stay open while you sleep.
                
Lose weight if you're overweight or obese. Even a little weight loss can improve your symptoms.
                
Sleep on your side instead of your back to help keep your throat open. You can sleep with special pillows or shirts that prevent you from sleeping on your back.
                
Keep your nasal passages open at night with nasal sprays or allergy medicines, if needed. Talk with your doctor about whether these treatments might help you.
                
If you smoke, quit. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking.
                
Mouthpieces
                
A mouthpiece, sometimes called an oral appliance, may help some people who have mild sleep apnea. Your doctor also may recommend a mouthpiece if you snore loudly but don't have sleep apnea.
                
A dentist or orthodontist can make a custom-fit plastic mouthpiece for treating sleep apnea. (An orthodontist specializes in correcting teeth or jaw problems.) The mouthpiece will adjust your lower jaw and your tongue to help keep your airways open while you sleep.
                
If you use a mouthpiece, tell your doctor if you have discomfort or pain while using the device. You may need periodic office visits so your doctor can adjust your mouthpiece to fit better.
                
Breathing Devices
                
CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) is the most common treatment for moderate to severe sleep apnea in adults. A CPAP machine uses a mask that fits over your mouth and nose, or just over your nose.
                
The machine gently blows air into your throat. The pressure from the air helps keep your airway open while you sleep.
                
Treating sleep apnea may help you stop snoring. But not snoring doesn't mean that you no longer have sleep apnea or can stop using CPAP. Your sleep apnea will return if you stop using your CPAP machine or dont use it correctly.
                
Usually, a technician will come to your home to bring the CPAP equipment. The technician will set up the CPAP machine and adjust it based on your doctor's prescription. After the initial setup, you may need to have the CPAP adjusted from time to time for the best results.
                
CPAP treatment may cause side effects in some people. These side effects include a dry or stuffy nose, irritated skin on your face, dry mouth, and headaches. If your CPAP isn't adjusted properly, you may get stomach bloating and discomfort while wearing the mask.
                
If you're having trouble with CPAP side effects, work with your sleep specialist, his or her nursing staff, and the CPAP technician. Together, you can take steps to reduce the side effects.
                
For example, the CPAP settings or size/fit of the mask might need to be adjusted. Adding moisture to the air as it flows through the mask or using nasal spray can help relieve a dry, stuffy, or runny nose.
                
There are many types of CPAP machines and masks. Tell your doctor if you're not happy with the type you're using. He or she may suggest switching to a different type that might work better for you.
                
People who have severe sleep apnea symptoms generally feel much better once they begin treatment with CPAP.
                
Surgery
                
Some people who have sleep apnea might benefit from surgery. The type of surgery and how well it works depend on the cause of the sleep apnea.
                
Surgery is done to widen breathing passages. It usually involves shrinking, stiffening, or removing excess tissue in the mouth and throat or resetting the lower jaw.
                
Surgery to shrink or stiffen excess tissue is done in a doctor's office or a hospital. Shrinking tissue may involve small shots or other treatments to the tissue. You may need a series of treatments to shrink the excess tissue. To stiffen excess tissue, the doctor makes a small cut in the tissue and inserts a piece of stiff plastic.
                
Surgery to remove excess tissue is done in a hospital. You're given medicine to help you sleep during the surgery. After surgery, you may have throat pain that lasts for 1 to 2 weeks.
                
Surgery to remove the tonsils, if they're blocking the airway, might be helpful for some children. Your child's doctor may suggest waiting some time to see whether these tissues shrink on their own. This is common as small children grow.",treatment,Sleep Apnea,What are the treatments for Sleep Apnea ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/heartmurmur,"A heart murmur isn't a disease. It's an extra or unusual sound heard during the heartbeat. Thus, murmurs themselves don't require treatment. However, if an underlying condition is causing a heart murmur, your doctor may recommend treatment for that condition.
                
Innocent (Harmless) Heart Murmurs
                
Healthy children who have innocent (harmless) heart murmurs don't need treatment. Their heart murmurs aren't caused by heart problems or other conditions.
                
Pregnant women who have innocent heart murmurs due to extra blood volume also don't need treatment. Their heart murmurs should go away after pregnancy.
                
Abnormal Heart Murmurs
                
If you or your child has an abnormal heart murmur, your doctor will recommend treatment for the disease or condition causing the murmur.
                
Some medical conditions, such as anemia or hyperthyroidism, can cause heart murmurs that aren't related to heart disease. Treating these conditions should make the heart murmur go away.
                
If a congenital heart defect is causing a heart murmur, treatment will depend on the type and severity of the defect. Treatment may include medicines or surgery. For more information about treatments for congenital heart defects, go to the Health Topics Congenital Heart Defects article.
                
If acquired heart valve disease is causing a heart murmur, treatment usually will depend on the type, amount, and severity of the disease.
                
Currently, no medicines can cure heart valve disease. However, lifestyle changes and medicines can treat symptoms and help delay complications. Eventually, though, you may need surgery to repair or replace a faulty heart valve.

NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/hf,"Early diagnosis and treatment can help people who have heart failure live longer, more active lives. Treatment for heart failure depends on the type and severity of the heart failure.
                
The goals of treatment for all stages of heart failure include:
                
Treating the conditions underlying cause, such ascoronary heart disease,high blood pressure, ordiabetes
                
Reducing symptoms
                
Stopping the heart failure from getting worse
                
Increasing your lifespan and improving your quality of life
                
Treatments usually include lifestyle changes, medicines, and ongoing care. If you have severe heart failure, you also may need medical procedures or surgery.
                
Heart-Healthy Lifestyle Changes
                
Your doctor may recommend heart-healthy lifestyle changes if you have heart failure. Heart-healthy lifestyle changes include:
                
Heart-healthy eating
                
Maintaining a healthy weight
                
Physical activity
                
Quitting smoking
                
Heart-Healthy Eating
                
Your doctor may recommend a heart-healthy eating plan, which should include:
                
Fat-free or low-fat dairy products, such as skim milk
                
Fish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and trout, about twice a week
                
Fruits, such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes
                
Legumes, such as kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans
                
Vegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and carrots
                
Whole grains, such as oatmeal, brown rice, and corn tortillas
                
When following a heart-healthy diet, you should avoid eating:
                
A lot of red meat
                
Palm and coconut oils
                
Sugary foods and beverages
                
Two nutrients in your diet make blood cholesterol levels rise:
                
Saturated fatfound mostly in foods that come from animals
                
Trans fat (trans fatty acids)found in foods made with hydrogenated oils and fats, such as stick margarine; baked goods, such as cookies, cakes, and pies; crackers; frostings; and coffee creamers. Some trans fats also occur naturally in animal fats andmeats.
                
Saturated fat raises your blood cholesterol more than anything else in your diet. When you follow a heart-healthy eating plan, only 5 percent to 6 percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. Food labels list the amounts of saturated fat. To help you stay on track, here are some examples:
                
If you eat:
                
Try to eat no more than:
                
1,200 calories a day                
                
8 grams of saturated fat a day      
                
1,500 calories a day
                
10 grams of saturated fat a day
                
1,800 calories a day
                
12 grams of saturated fat a day
                
2,000 calories a day
                
13 grams of saturated fat a day
                
2,500 calories a day
                
17 grams of saturated fat a day
                
Not all fats are bad. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats actually help lower blood cholesterollevels.
                
Some sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are:
                
Avocados
                
Corn, sunflower, and soybean oils
                
Nuts and seeds, such as walnuts
                
Olive, canola, peanut, safflower, and sesame oils
                
Peanut butter
                
Salmon and trout
                
Tofu
                
Sodium
                
You should try to limit the amount of sodium that you eat. This means choosing and preparing foods that are lower in salt and sodium. Try to use low-sodium and no added salt foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. Food labels tell you what you need to know about choosing foods that are lower in sodium. Try to eat no more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium a day. If you have high blood pressure, you may need to restrict your sodium intake even more.
                
Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension
                
Your doctor may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan if you have high blood pressure. The DASH eating plan focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and low in fat, cholesterol, and sodium and salt.
                
The DASH eating plan is a good heart-healthy eating plan, even for those who dont have high blood pressure. Read more about DASH.
                
Liquid Intake
                
Its important for people who have heart failure to take in the correct amounts and types of liquids. Consuming too much liquid can worsen heart failure. Also, if you have heart failure, you shouldnt drink alcohol. Talk with your doctor about what amounts and types of liquids you should have each day.
                
Maintaining a Healthy Weight
                
Maintaining a healthy weight is important for overall health and can lower your risk for heart failure and coronary heart disease. Aim for a Healthy Weight by following a heart-healthy eating plan and keeping physically active.
                
Knowing your body mass index (BMI) helps you find out if youre a healthy weight in relation to your height and gives an estimate of your total body fat. To figure out your BMI, check out the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes (NHLBI) online BMI calculator or talk to your doctor. A BMI:
                
Below 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight.
                
Between 18.5 and 24.9 is in the normal range.
                
Between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight.
                
Of 30 or more is considered obese.
                
A general goal to aim for is a BMI below 25. Your doctor or health care provider can help you set an appropriate BMI goal.
                
Measuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. If most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type 2 diabetes. This risk may be higher with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. To learn how to measure your waist, visit Assessing Your Weight and Health Risk.
                
If youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. A loss of just 3 percent to 5 percent of your current weight can lower your triglycerides, blood glucose, and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Greater amounts of weight loss can improve blood pressure readings, lower LDL cholesterol, and increase HDL cholesterol.
                
Physical Activity
                
Routine physical activity can lower many coronary heart disease risk factors, including LDL (bad) cholesterol, high blood pressure, and excess weight. Physical activity also can lower your risk for diabetes and raise your HDL cholesterol level. HDL is the good cholesterol that helps prevent coronary heart disease.
                
Everyone should try to participate in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2hours and 30minutes per week, or vigorous aerobic exercise for 1hour and 15minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats faster and you use more oxygen than usual. The more active you are, the more you will benefit. Participate in aerobic exercise for at least 10minutes at a time spread throughout the week.

Physical Activity and Your Heart
                
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines forAmericans
                
Talk with your doctor before you start a new exercise plan. Ask your doctor how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you.
                
Quitting Smoking
                
If you smoke, quit. Smoking can raise your risk for coronary heart disease and heart attack and worsen heart failure. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke.
                
If you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking.
                
Read more about quitting smoking at Smoking and Your Heart.
                
Medicines
                
Your doctor will prescribe medicines based on the type of heart failure you have, how severe it is, and your response to certain medicines. The following medicines are commonly used to treat heart failure:
                
ACE inhibitors lower blood pressure and reduce strain on your heart. They also may reduce the risk of a futureheart attack.
                
Aldosterone antagonists trigger the body to remove excess sodium through urine. This lowers the volume of blood that the heart must pump.
                
Angiotensin receptor blockers relax your blood vessels and lower blood pressure to decrease your hearts workload.
                
Beta blockers slow your heart rate and lower your blood pressure to decrease your hearts workload.
                
Digoxin makes the heart beat stronger and pump more blood.
                
Diuretics (fluid pills) help reduce fluid buildup in your lungs and swelling in your feet and ankles.
                
Isosorbide dinitrate/hydralazine hydrochloride helps relax your blood vessels so your heart doesnt work as hard to pump blood. Studies have shown that this medicine can reduce the risk of death in blacks. More studies are needed to find out whether this medicine will benefit other racial groups.
                
Take all medicines regularly, as your doctor prescribes. Dont change the amount of your medicine or skip a dose unless your doctor tells you to. You should still follow a heart healthy lifestyle, even if you take medicines to treat your heart failure.
                
Ongoing Care
                
You should watch for signs that heart failure is getting worse. For example, weight gain may mean that fluids are building up in your body. Ask your doctor how often you should check your weight and when to report weight changes.
                
Getting medical care for other related conditions is important. If you have diabetes or high blood pressure, work with your health care team to control these conditions. Have your blood sugar level and blood pressure checked. Talk with your doctor about when you should have tests and how often to take measurements at home.
                
Try to avoid respiratory infections like the flu andpneumonia. Talk with your doctor or nurse about getting flu and pneumonia vaccines.
                
Many people who have severe heart failure may need treatment in a hospital from time to time. Your doctor may recommend oxygen therapy, which can be given in a hospital or at home.
                
Medical Procedures and Surgery
                
As heart failure worsens, lifestyle changes and medicines may no longer control your symptoms. You may need a medical procedure or surgery.
                
In heart failure, the right and left sides of the heart may no longer contract at the same time. This disrupts the hearts pumping. To correct this problem, your doctor might implant a cardiac resynchronization therapy device (a type ofpacemaker) near your heart. This device helps both sides of your heart contract at the same time, which can decrease heart failure symptoms.
                
Some people who have heart failure have very rapid, irregular heartbeats. Without treatment, these heartbeats can causesudden cardiac arrest. Your doctor might implant an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) near your heart to solve this problem. An ICD checks your heart rate and uses electrical pulses to correct irregular heart rhythms.
                
People who have severe heart failure symptoms at rest, despite other treatments, may need:
                
A mechanical heart pump, such as aleft ventricular assist device. This device helps pump blood from the heart to the rest of the body. You may use a heart pump until you have surgery or as a long-term treatment.
                
Heart transplant. A heart transplant is an operation in which a persons diseased heart is replaced with a healthy heart from a deceased donor. Heart transplants are done as a life-saving measure for end-stage heart failure when medical treatment and less drastic surgery have failed.",treatment,Heart Failure,What are the treatments for Heart Failure ?,Drugs

For People Who Have Healthy Hearts
                
If you have a healthy heart, you can take action to prevent heart disease and heart failure. To reduce your risk of heart disease:
                
Avoid using illegal drugs.
                
Be physically active. The more active you are, the more you will benefit.
                
Follow a heart-healthy eating plan.
                
If yousmoke, make an effort to quit. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke.
                
Maintain a healthy weight. Work with your health care team to create a reasonable weight-loss plan.
                
For People Who Are at High Risk for Heart Failure
                
Even if youre at high risk for heart failure, you can take steps to reduce your risk. People at high risk include those who have coronary heart disease,high blood pressure, ordiabetes.
                
Follow all of the steps listed above. Talk with your doctor about what types and amounts of physical activity are safe for you.

NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/vv,"Varicose veins are treated with lifestyle changes and medical procedures. The goals of treatment are to relieve symptoms, prevent complications, and improve appearance.
                
If varicose veins cause few symptoms, your doctor may simply suggest making lifestyle changes. If your symptoms are more severe, your doctor may recommend one or more medical procedures. For example, you may need a medical procedure if you have a lot of pain, blood clots, or skin disorders caused by your varicose veins.
                
Some people who have varicose veins choose to have procedures to improve how their veins look.
                
Although treatment can help existing varicose veins, it can't keep new varicose veins from forming.
                
Lifestyle Changes
                
Lifestyle changes often are the first treatment for varicose veins. These changes can prevent varicose veins from getting worse, reduce pain, and delay other varicose veins from forming. Lifestyle changes include the following:
                
Avoid standing or sitting for long periods without taking a break. When sitting, avoid crossing your legs. Keep your legs raised when sitting, resting, or sleeping. When you can, raise your legs above the level of your heart.
                
Do physical activities to get your legs moving and improve muscle tone. This helps blood move through your veins.
                
If you're overweight or obese, try to lose weight. This will improve blood flow and ease the pressure on your veins.
                
Avoid wearing tight clothes, especially those that are tight around your waist, groin (upper thighs), and legs. Tight clothes can make varicose veins worse.
                
Avoid wearing high heels for long periods. Lower heeled shoes can help tone your calf muscles. Toned muscles help blood move through the veins.
                
Your doctor may recommend compression stockings. These stockings create gentle pressure up the leg. This pressure keeps blood from pooling and decreases swelling in the legs.
                
There are three types of compression stockings. One type is support pantyhose. These offer the least amount of pressure. A second type is over-the-counter compression hose. These stockings give a little more pressure than support pantyhose. Over-the-counter compression hose are sold in medical supply stores and pharmacies.
                
Prescription-strength compression hose are the third type of compression stockings. These stockings offer the greatest amount of pressure. They also are sold in medical supply stores and pharmacies. However, you need to be fitted for them in the store by a specially trained person.
                
Medical Procedures
                
Medical procedures are done either to remove varicose veins or to close them. Removing or closing varicose veins usually doesn't cause problems with blood flow because the blood starts moving through other veins.
                
You may be treated with one or more of the procedures described below. Common side effects right after most of these procedures include bruising, swelling, skin discoloration, and slight pain.
                
The side effects are most severe with vein stripping and ligation (li-GA-shun). Rarely, this procedure can cause severe pain, infections, blood clots, and scarring.
                
Sclerotherapy
                
Sclerotherapy (SKLER-o-ther-ah-pe) uses a liquid chemical to close off a varicose vein. The chemical is injected into the vein to cause irritation and scarring inside the vein. The irritation and scarring cause the vein to close off, and it fades away.
                
This procedure often is used to treat smaller varicose veins and spider veins. It can be done in your doctor's office, while you stand. You may need several treatments to completely close off a vein.
                
Treatments typically are done every 4 to 6 weeks. Following treatments, your legs will be wrapped in elastic bandaging to help with healing and decrease swelling.
                
Microsclerotherapy
                
Microsclerotherapy (MI-kro-SKLER-o-ther-ah-pe) is used to treat spider veins and other very small varicose veins.
                
A small amount of liquid chemical is injected into a vein using a very fine needle. The chemical scars the inner lining of the vein, causing it to close off.
                
Laser Surgery
                
This procedure applies light energy from a laser onto a varicose vein. The laser light makes the vein fade away.
                
Laser surgery mostly is used to treat smaller varicose veins. No cutting or injection of chemicals is involved.
                
Endovenous Ablation Therapy
                
Endovenous ablation (ab-LA-shun) therapy uses lasers or radiowaves to create heat to close off a varicose vein.
                
Your doctor makes a tiny cut in your skin near the varicose vein. He or she then inserts a small tube called a catheter into the vein. A device at the tip of the tube heats up the inside of the vein and closes it off.
                
You'll be awake during this procedure, but your doctor will numb the area around the vein. You usually can go home the same day as the procedure.
                
Endoscopic Vein Surgery
                
For endoscopic (en-do-SKOP-ik) vein surgery, your doctor will make a small cut in your skin near a varicose vein. He or she then uses a tiny camera at the end of a thin tube to move through the vein. A surgical device at the end of the camera is used to close the vein.
                
Endoscopic vein surgery usually is used only in severe cases when varicose veins are causing skin ulcers (sores). After the procedure, you usually can return to your normal activities within a few weeks.
                
Ambulatory Phlebectomy
                
For ambulatory phlebectomy (fle-BEK-to-me), your doctor will make small cuts in your skin to remove small varicose veins. This procedure usually is done to remove the varicose veins closest to the surface of your skin.
                
You'll be awake during the procedure, but your doctor will numb the area around the vein. Usually, you can go home the same day that the procedure is done.
                
Vein Stripping and Ligation
                
Vein stripping and ligation typically is done only for severe cases of varicose veins. The procedure involves tying shut and removing the veins through small cuts in your skin.
                
You'll be given medicine to temporarily put you to sleep so you don't feel any pain during the procedure.
                
Vein stripping and ligation usually is done as an outpatient procedure. The recovery time from the procedure is about 1 to 4 weeks.",treatment,Varicose Veins,What are the treatments for Varicose Veins ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/vv,"You can't prevent varicose veins from forming. However, you can prevent the ones you have from getting worse. You also can take steps to delay other varicose veins from forming.
                
Avoid standing or sitting for long periods without taking a break. When sitting, avoid crossing your legs. Keep your legs raised when sitting, resting, or sleeping. When you can, raise your legs above the level of your heart.
                
Do physical activities to get your legs moving and improve muscle tone. This helps blood move through your veins.
                
If you're overweight or obese, try to lose weight. This will improve blood flow and ease the pressure on your veins.
                
Avoid wearing tight clothes, especially those that are tight around your waist, groin (upper thighs), and legs. Tight clothes can make varicose veins worse.
                
Avoid wearing high heels for long periods. Lower heeled shoes can help tone your calf muscles. Toned muscles help blood move through the veins.
                
Wear compression stockings if your doctor recommends them. These stockings create gentle pressure up the leg. This pressure keeps blood from pooling in the veins and decreases swelling in the legs.",prevention,Varicose Veins,How to prevent Varicose Veins ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/kd,"Medicines are the main treatment for Kawasaki disease. Rarely, children whose coronary (heart) arteries are affected may need medical procedures or surgery.
                
The goals of treatment include:
                
Reducing fever and inflammation to improve symptoms
                
Preventing the disease from affecting the coronary arteries
                
Initial Treatment
                
Kawasaki disease can cause serious health problems. Thus, your child will likely be treated in a hospital, at least for the early part of treatment.
                
The standard treatment during the disease's acute phase is high-dose aspirin and immune globulin. Immune globulin is a medicine that's injected into a vein.
                
Most children who receive these treatments improve greatly within 24 hours. For a small number of children, fever remains. These children may need a second round of immune globulin.
                
At the start of treatment, your child will receive high doses of aspirin. As soon as his or her fever goes away, a low dose of aspirin is given. The low dose helps prevent blood clots, which can form in the inflamed small arteries.
                
Most children treated for Kawasaki disease fully recover from the acute phase and don't need any further treatment. They should, however, follow a healthy diet and adopt healthy lifestyle habits. Taking these steps can help lower the risk of future heart disease. (Following a healthy lifestyle is advised for all children, not just those who have Kawasaki disease.)
                
Children who have had immune globulin should wait 11 months before having the measles and chicken pox vaccines. Immune globulin can prevent those vaccines from working well.
                
Long-Term Care and Treatment
                
If Kawasaki disease has affected your child's coronary arteries, he or she will need ongoing care and treatment.
                
It's best if a pediatric cardiologist provides this care to reduce the risk of severe heart problems. A pediatric cardiologist is a doctor who specializes in treating children who have heart problems.
                
Medicines and Tests
                
When Kawasaki disease affects the coronary arteries, they may expand and twist. If this happens, your child's doctor may prescribe blood-thinning medicines (for example, warfarin). These medicines help prevent blood clots from forming in the affected coronary arteries.
                
Blood-thinning medicines usually are stopped after the coronary arteries heal. Healing may occur about 18 months after the acute phase of the disease.
                
In a small number of children, the coronary arteries don't heal. These children likely will need routine tests, such as:
                
Echocardiography. This test uses sound waves to create images of the heart.
                
EKG (electrocardiogram). This test detects and records the heart's electrical activity.
                
Stress test. This test provides information about how the heart works during physical activity or stress.
                
Medical Procedures and Surgery
                
Rarely, a child who has Kawasaki disease may needcardiac catheterization(KATH-eh-ter-ih-ZA-shun). Doctors use this procedure to diagnose and treat some heart conditions.
                
A flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in the arm, groin (upper thigh), or neck and threaded to the heart. Through the catheter, doctors can perform tests and treatments on the heart.
                
Very rarely, a child may need to have other procedures or surgery if inflammation narrows his or her coronary arteries and blocks blood flow to the heart.
                
Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), stent placement, or coronary artery bypass grafting(CABG) may be used.
                
Coronary angioplasty restores blood flow through narrowed or blocked coronary arteries. A thin tube with a balloon on the end is inserted into a blood vessel in the arm or groin. The tube is threaded to the narrowed or blocked coronary artery. Then, the balloon is inflated to widen the artery and restore blood flow.
                
A stent (small mesh tube) may be placed in the coronary artery during angioplasty. This device helps support the narrowed or weakened artery. A stent can improve blood flow and prevent the artery from bursting.
                
Rarely, a child may need to have CABG. This surgery is used to treat blocked coronary arteries. During CABG, a healthy artery or vein from another part of the body is connected, or grafted, to the blocked coronary artery.
                
The grafted artery or vein bypasses (that is, goes around) the blocked part of the coronary artery. This improves blood flow to the heart.",treatment,Kawasaki Disease,What are the treatments for Kawasaki Disease ?,Drugs

NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/rh,"Rh incompatibility is treated with a medicine called Rh immune globulin. Treatment for a baby who has hemolytic anemia will vary based on the severity of the condition.
                
Goals of Treatment
                
The goals of treating Rh incompatibility are to ensure that your baby is healthy and to lower your risk for the condition in future pregnancies.
                
Treatment for Rh Incompatibility
                
If Rh incompatibility is diagnosed during your pregnancy, you'll receive Rh immune globulin in your seventh month of pregnancy and again within 72 hours of delivery.
                
You also may receive Rh immune globulin if the risk of blood transfer between you and the baby is high (for example, if you've had a miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, or bleeding during pregnancy).
                
Rh immune globulin contains Rh antibodies that attach to the Rh-positive blood cells in your blood. When this happens, your body doesn't react to the baby's Rh-positive cells as a foreign substance. As a result, your body doesn't make Rh antibodies. Rh immune globulin must be given at the correct times to work properly.
                
Once you have formed Rh antibodies, the medicine will no longer help. That's why a woman who has Rh-negative blood must be treated with the medicine with each pregnancy or any other event that allows her blood to mix with Rh-positive blood.
                
Rh immune globulin is injected into the muscle of your arm or buttock. Side effects may include soreness at the injection site and a slight fever. The medicine also may be injected into a vein.
                
Treatment for Hemolytic Anemia
                
Several options are available for treating hemolytic anemia in a baby. In mild cases, no treatment may be needed. If treatment is needed, the baby may be given a medicine called erythropoietin and iron supplements. These treatments can prompt the body to make red blood cells.
                
If the hemolytic anemia is severe, the baby may get a blood transfusion through the umbilical cord. If the hemolytic anemia is severe and the baby is almost full-term, your doctor may induce labor early. This allows the baby's doctor to begin treatment right away.
                
A newborn who has severe anemia may be treated with a blood exchange transfusion. The procedure involves slowly removing the newborn's blood and replacing it with fresh blood or plasma from a donor.
                
Newborns also may be treated with special lights to reduce the amount of bilirubin in their blood. These babies may have jaundice (a yellowish color of the skin and whites of the eyes). High levels of bilirubin cause jaundice.
                
Reducing the blood's bilirubin level is important because high levels of this compound can cause brain damage. High levels of bilirubin often are seen in babies who have hemolytic anemia. This is because the compound forms when red blood cells break down.",treatment,Rh Incompatibility,What are the treatments for Rh Incompatibility ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/rh,"Rh incompatibility can be prevented with Rh immune globulin, as long as the medicine is given at the correct times. Once you have formed Rh antibodies, the medicine will no longer help.
                
Thus, a woman who has Rh-negative blood must be treated with Rh immune globulin during and after each pregnancy or after any other event that allows her blood to mix with Rh-positive blood.
                
Early prenatal care also can help prevent some of the problems linked to Rh incompatibility. For example, your doctor can find out early whether you're at risk for the condition.

NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/hyp,"Treatment depends on the type of hypotension you have and the severity of your signs and symptoms. The goal of treatment is to bring blood pressure back to normal to relieve signs and symptoms. Another goal is to manage any underlying condition causing the hypotension.
                
Your response to treatment depends on your age, overall health, and strength. It also depends on how easily you can stop, start, or change medicines.
                
In a healthy person, low blood pressure without signs or symptoms usually isn't a problem and needs no treatment.
                
If you have signs or symptoms of hypotension, you should sit or lie down right away. Put your feet above the level of your heart. If your signs or symptoms don't go away quickly, you should seek medical care.
                
Orthostatic Hypotension
                
Many treatments are available for orthostatic hypotension. If you have this condition, your doctor may advise making lifestyle changes, such as:
                
Drinking plenty of fluids, such as water or sports drinks that contain nutrients like sodium and potassium.
                
Drinking little or no alcohol.
                
Standing up slowly.
                
Not crossing your legs while sitting.
                
Slowly increasing the amount of time you sit up if you've been immobile for a long time because of a medical condition. The term ""immobile"" refers to not being able to move around very much.
                
Eating small, low-carbohydrate meals if you have postprandial hypotension (a form of orthostatic hypotension).
                
Talk with your doctor about using compression stockings. These stockings apply pressure to your lower legs. The pressure helps move blood throughout your body.
                
If medicine is causing your low blood pressure, your doctor may change the medicine or adjust the dose you take.
                
Several medicines are used to treat orthostatic hypotension. These medicines, which raise blood pressure, include fludrocortisone and midodrine.
                
Neurally Mediated Hypotension
                
If you have neurally mediated hypotension (NMH), you may need to make lifestyle changes. These may include:
                
Avoiding situations that trigger symptoms, such as standing for long periods. Unpleasant, upsetting, or scary situations also can trigger symptoms.
                
Drinking plenty of fluids, such as water or sports drinks that contain nutrients like sodium and potassium.
                
Increasing your salt intake (as your doctor advises).
                
Learning to recognize symptoms that occur before fainting and taking action to raise your blood pressure. For example, sitting down and putting your head between your knees or lying down can help raise blood pressure.
                
If medicine is causing your hypotension, your doctor may change the medicine or adjust the dose you take. He or she also may prescribe medicine to treat NMH.
                
Children who have NHM often outgrow it.
                
Severe Hypotension Linked to Shock
                
Shock is a life-threatening emergency. People who have shock need prompt treatment from medical personnel. If a person has signs or symptoms of shock, call 911 right away.
                
The goals of treating shock are to:
                
Restore blood flow to the organs as quickly as possible to prevent organ damage
                
Find and reverse the cause of shock
                
Blood or special fluids are put into the bloodstream to restore blood flow to the organs. Medicines can help raise blood pressure or make the heartbeat stronger.

NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/rls,"Restless legs syndrome (RLS) has no cure. If a condition or medicine triggers RLS, it may go away or get better if the trigger is relieved or stopped.
                
RLS can be treated. The goals of treatment are to:
                
Prevent or relieve symptoms
                
Increase the amount of sleep you're getting and improve the quality of your sleep
                
Treat or correct any underlying condition that may trigger or worsen RLS
                
Mild cases of RLS often are treated with lifestyle changes and sometimes with periodic use of medicines. More severe RLS usually is treated with daily medicines.
                
Lifestyle Changes
                
Lifestyle changes can prevent or relieve the symptoms of RLS. For mild RLS, lifestyle changes may be the only treatment needed.
                
Preventing Symptoms
                
Many common substances, such as alcohol and tobacco, can trigger RLS symptoms. Avoiding these substances can limit or prevent symptoms.
                
Some prescription and over-the-counter medicines can cause or worsen RLS symptoms. Tell your doctor about all of the medicines you're taking. He or she can tell you whether you should stop or change certain medicines.
                
Adopting good sleep habits can help you fall asleep and stay asleepa problem for many people who have RLS. Good sleep habits include:
                
Keeping the area where you sleep cool, quiet, comfortable, and as dark as possible.
                
Making your bedroom sleep-friendly. Remove things that can interfere with sleep, such as a TV, computer, or phone.
                
Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day. Some people who have RLS find it helpful to go to bed later in the evening and get up later in the morning.
                
Avoiding staying in bed awake for long periods in the evening or during the night.
                
Doing a challenging activity before bedtime, such as solving a crossword puzzle, may ease your RLS symptoms. This distraction may make it easier for you to fall asleep. Focusing on your breathing and using other relaxation techniques also may help you fall asleep.
                
Regular, moderate physical activity also can help limit or prevent RLS symptoms. Often, people who have RLS find that if they increase their activity during the day, they have fewer symptoms.
                
Relieving Symptoms
                
Certain activities can relieve RLS symptoms. These include:
                
Walking or stretching
                
Taking a hot or cold bath
                
Massaging the affected limb(s)
                
Using heat or ice packs on the affected limb(s)
                
Doing mentally challenging tasks
                
Choose an aisle seat at the movies or on airplanes and trains so you can move around, if necessary.
                
Medicines
                
You may need medicines to treat RLS if lifestyle changes can't control symptoms. Many medicines can relieve or prevent RLS symptoms.
                
No single medicine works for all people who have RLS. It may take several changes in medicines and dosages to find the best approach. Sometimes, a medicine will work for a while and then stop working.
                
Some of the medicines used to treat RLS also are used to treat Parkinson's disease. These medicines make dopamine or mimic it in the parts of the brain that control movement. (Dopamine is a chemical that helps you move properly.)
                
If medicines for Parkinson's disease don't prevent or relieve your symptoms, your doctor may prescribe other medicines. You may have to take more than one medicine to treat your RLS.
                
Always talk with your doctor before taking any medicines. He or she can tell you the side effects of each RLS medicine. Side effects may include nausea (feeling sick to your stomach), headache, and daytime sleepiness.
                
In some cases, RLS medicines may worsen problems with excessive gambling, shopping, or sexual activity. Sometimes, continued use of RLS medicines may make your RLS symptoms worse.

Prevent CHD complications.
                
Lifestyle Changes
                
Making lifestyle changes can help prevent or treat CHD. These changes may be the only treatment that some people need.
                
Quit Smoking
                
If you smoke or use tobacco, try to quit. Smoking can raise your risk for CHD and heart attack and worsen other CHD risk factors. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke.
                
If you find it hard to quit smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking.
                
For more information about how to quit smoking, go to the Health Topics Smoking and Your Heart article and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's (NHLBI's) ""Your Guide to a Healthy Heart.""
                
Follow a Healthy Diet
                
A healthy diet is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. A healthy diet includes a variety of vegetables and fruits. These foods can be fresh, canned, frozen, or dried. A good rule is to try to fill half of your plate with vegetables and fruits.
                
A healthy diet also includes whole grains, fat-free or low-fat dairy products, and protein foods, such as lean meats, poultry without skin, seafood, processed soy products, nuts, seeds, beans, and peas.
                
Choose and prepare foods with little sodium (salt). Too much salt can raise your risk for high blood pressure. Studies show that following the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan can lower blood pressure.
                
Try to avoid foods and drinks that are high in added sugars. For example, drink water instead of sugary drinks, like soda.
                
Also, try to limit the amount of solid fats and refined grains that you eat. Solid fats are saturated fat and trans fatty acids. Refined grains come from processing whole grains, which results in a loss of nutrients (such as dietary fiber).
                
If you drink alcohol, do so in moderation. Research suggests that regularly drinking small to moderate amounts of alcohol may lower the risk of CHD. Women should have no more than one alcoholic drink a day.
                
One drink a day can lower your CHD risk by raising your HDL cholesterol level. One drink is a glass of wine, beer, or a small amount of hard liquor.
                
If you don't drink, this isn't a recommendation to start using alcohol. Also, you shouldn't drink if you're pregnant, if you're planning to become pregnant, or if you have another health condition that could make alcohol use harmful.
                
Too much alcohol can cause you to gain weight and raise your blood pressure and triglyceride level. In women, even one drink a day may raise the risk of certain types of cancer.
                
For more information about following a healthy diet, go to the NHLBI's ""Your Guide to Lowering Your Blood Pressure With DASH"" and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's ChooseMyPlate.gov Web site. Both resources provide general information about healthy eating.
                
Be Physically Active
                
Regular physical activity can lower many CHD risk factors, including high LDL cholesterol,high blood pressure, and excess weight.
                
Physical activity also can lower your risk for diabetes and raise your HDL cholesterol level. (HDL cholesterol helps remove cholesterol from your arteries.)
                
Talk with your doctor before you start a new exercise plan. Ask him or her how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you.
                
People gain health benefits from as little as 60 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week. Walking is an excellent heart healthy exercise. The more active you are, the more you will benefit.
                
For more information about physical activity, go to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' ""2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans,"" the Health Topics Physical Activity and Your Heart article, and the NHLBI's ""Your Guide to Physical Activity and Your Heart.""
                
Maintain a Healthy Weight
                
Overweight and obesity are risk factors for CHD. If you're overweight or obese, try to lose weight. Cut back your calorie intake and do more physical activity. Eat smaller portions and choose lower calorie foods. Your health care provider may refer you to a dietitian to help you manage your weight.
                
A BMI of less than 25 and a waist circumference of 35 inches or less is the goal for preventing and treating CHD. BMI measures your weight in relation to your height and gives an estimate of your total body fat. You can use the NHLBI's online BMI calculator to figure out your BMI, or your doctor can help you.
                
To measure your waist, stand and place a tape measure around your middle, just above your hipbones. Measure your waist just after you breathe out. Make sure the tape is snug but doesn't squeeze the flesh.
                
For more information about losing weight or maintaining a healthy weight, go to the NHLBI's Aim for a Healthy Weight Web site.
                
Stress and Depression
                
Research shows that getting upset or angry can trigger a heart attack. Also, some of the ways people cope with stresssuch as drinking, smoking, or overeatingaren't heart healthy.
                
Learning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health.
                
Having supportive people in your life with whom you can share your feelings or concerns can help relieve stress. Physical activity, yoga, and relaxation therapy also can help relieve stress. You may want to consider taking part in a stress management program.
                
Depression can double or triple your risk for CHD. Depression also makes it hard to maintain a heart healthy lifestyle.
                
Talk with your doctor if you have symptoms of depression, such as feeling hopeless or not taking interest in daily activities. He or she may recommend counseling or prescribe medicines to help you manage the condition.
                
Medicines
                
You may need medicines to treat CHD if lifestyle changes aren't enough. Medicines can help:
                
Reduce your heart's workload and relieve CHD symptoms
                
Decrease your chance of having a heart attack or dying suddenly
                
Lower your LDL cholesterol, blood pressure, and other CHD risk factors
                
Prevent blood clots
                
Prevent or delay the need for a procedure or surgery, such asangioplasty (AN-jee-oh-plas-tee) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)
                
Women who havecoronary microvascular disease and anemiamay benefit from taking medicine to treat the anemia.
                
Women who have broken heart syndrome also may need medicines. Doctors may prescribe medicines to relieve fluid buildup, treat blood pressure problems, prevent blood clots, and manage stress hormones. Most people who have broken heart syndrome make a full recovery within weeks.
                
Take all of your medicines as prescribed. If you have side effects or other problems related to your medicines, tell your doctor. He or she may be able to provide other options.
                
Menopausal Hormone Therapy
                
Recent studies have shown that menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) doesn't prevent CHD. Some studies have even shown that MHT increases women's risk for CHD, stroke, and breast cancer.
                
However, these studies tested MHT on women who had been postmenopausal for at least several years. During that time, they could have already developed CHD.
                
Research is ongoing to see whether MHT helps prevent CHD when taken right when menopause starts. While questions remain, current findings suggest MHT shouldn't routinely be used to prevent or treat CHD.
                
Ask your doctor about other ways to prevent or treat CHD, including lifestyle changes and medicines. For more information about MHT, go to the NHLBI's Postmenopausal Hormone Therapy Web site.
                
Procedures and Surgery
                
You may need a procedure or surgery to treat CHD. Both angioplasty and CABG are used as treatments. You and your doctor can discuss which treatment is right for you.
                
Percutaneous Coronary Intervention
                
Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), commonly known as angioplasty (AN-jee-oh-plas-tee), is a nonsurgical procedure that opens blocked or narrowed coronary arteries.
                
A thin, flexible tube with a balloon or other device on the end is threaded through a blood vessel to the narrowed or blocked coronary artery. Once in place, the balloon is inflated to compress the plaque against the wall of the artery. This restores blood flow through the artery.
                
PCI can improve blood flow to your heart and relieve chest pain. A small mesh tube called a stent usually is placed in the artery to help keep it open after the procedure.
                
For more information, go to the Health Topics PCI article.
                
Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting
                
CABG is a type of surgery. During CABG, a surgeon removes arteries or veins from other areas in your body and uses them to bypass (that is, go around) narrowed or blocked coronary arteries.
                
CABG can improve blood flow to your heart, relieve chest pain, and possibly prevent a heart attack.
                
For more information, go to the Health Topics Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting article.
                
Cardiac Rehabilitation
                
Your doctor may prescribe cardiac rehab foranginaor after angioplasty, CABG, or a heart attack. Almost everyone who has CHD can benefit from cardiac rehab.
                
Cardiac rehab is a medically supervised program that can improve the health and well-being of people who have heart problems.
                
The cardiac rehab team may include doctors, nurses, exercise specialists, physical and occupational therapists, dietitians or nutritionists, and psychologists or other mental health specialists.
                
Cardiac rehab has two parts:
                
Exercise training. This part of rehab helps you learn how to exercise safely, strengthen your muscles, and improve your stamina. Your exercise plan will be based on your personal abilities, needs, and interests.
                
Education, counseling, and training. This part of rehab helps you understand your heart condition and find ways to lower your risk for future heart problems. The rehab team will help you learn how to cope with the stress of adjusting to a new lifestyle and with your fears about the future.

NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/hdw,"Taking action to control your risk factors can help prevent or delaycoronary heart disease(CHD). Your risk for CHD increases with the number of CHD risk factors you have.
                
One step you can take is to adopt a heart healthy lifestyle. A heart healthy lifestyle should be part of a lifelong approach to healthy living.
                
For example, if you smoke, try to quit. Smoking can raise your risk for CHD andheart attackand worsen other CHD risk factors. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke.

NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/rf,"Treatment for respiratory failure depends on whether the condition is acute (short-term) or chronic (ongoing) and its severity. Treatment also depends on the condition's underlying cause.
                
Acute respiratory failure can be a medical emergency. It often is treated in an intensive care unit at a hospital. Chronic respiratory failure often can be treated at home. If chronic respiratory failure is severe, your doctor may recommend treatment in a long-term care center.
                
One of the main goals of treating respiratory failure is to get oxygen to your lungs and other organs and remove carbon dioxide from your body. Another goal is to treat the underlying cause of the condition.
                
Oxygen Therapy and Ventilator Support
                
If you have respiratory failure, you may receive oxygen therapy. Extra oxygen is given through a nasal cannula (two small plastic tubes, or prongs, that are placed in both nostrils) or through a mask that fits over your nose and mouth.
                
Oxygen Therapy
                

                
Oxygen also can be given through a tracheostomy (TRA-ke-OS-to-me). This is a surgically made hole that goes through the front of your neck and into your windpipe. A breathing tube, also called a tracheostomy or trach tube, is placed in the hole to help you breathe.
                
Tracheostomy
                

                
If the oxygen level in your blood doesn't increase, or if you're still having trouble breathing, your doctor may recommend a ventilator. A ventilator is a machine that supports breathing. It blows airor air with increased amounts of oxygeninto your airways and then your lungs.
                
Ventilator
                

                
Your doctor will adjust the ventilator as needed. This will help your lungs get the right amount of oxygen. It also can prevent the machine's pressure from injuring your lungs. You'll use the ventilator until you can breathe on your own.
                
Other Treatments To Help You Breathe
                
Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) and a rocking bed are two methods that can help you breathe better while you sleep. These methods are very useful for people who have chronic respiratory failure.
                
NPPV is a treatment that uses mild air pressure to keep your airways open while you sleep. You wear a mask or other device that fits over your nose or your nose and mouth. A tube connects the mask to a machine, which blows air into the tube.
                
CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) is one type of NPPV. For more information, go to the Health Topics CPAP article. Although the article focuses on CPAP treatment for sleep apnea, it explains how CPAP works.
                
A rocking bed consists of a mattress on a motorized platform. The mattress gently rocks back and forth. When your head rocks down, the organs in your abdomen and your diaphragm (the main muscle used for breathing) slide up, helping you exhale. When your head rocks up, the organs in your abdomen and your diaphragm slide down, helping you inhale.
                
Fluids
                
You may be given fluids to improve blood flow throughout your body and to provide nutrition. Your doctor will make sure you get the right amount of fluids.
                
Too much fluid can fill the lungs and make it hard for you to get the oxygen you need. Not enough fluid can limit the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the body's organs.
                
Fluids usually are given through an intravenous (IV) line inserted in one of your blood vessels.
                
Medicines
                
Your doctor may prescribe medicines to relieve discomfort.
                
Treatments for the Underlying Cause of Respiratory Failure
                
Once your doctor figures out what's causing your respiratory failure, he or she will plan how to treat that disease or condition. Treatments may include medicines, procedures, and other therapies.",treatment,Respiratory Failure,What are the treatments for Respiratory Failure ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/hp,"The best way to treat hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is to avoid the antigen that caused it. (An antigen is a substance that your body reacts against, such as molds, dusts, and chemicals.)
                
In acute (short-term) HP, symptoms usually go away once you're no longer in contact with the antigen. In chronic (ongoing) HP, you may need medicines to relieve your symptoms.
                
People who have chronic HP may develop pulmonary fibrosis. This is a condition in which tissue deep in your lungs becomes scarred over time. People who have this condition may need further treatment, such as oxygen therapy and pulmonary rehabilitation (rehab).
                
Avoiding Antigens
                
Once the antigen that caused the HP and its source are found, you can take steps to avoid it. If HP is caught early, avoiding the antigen may be the only treatment you need.
                
Avoiding an antigen may be easier at home than at work. For example, if your pet bird, moldy carpet, or hot tub is the source of the antigen, you can remove it from your home. If your heating system is the source of the antigen, you can have your system properly serviced.
                
However, if the antigen is at work, you may need to talk with your supervisor about your condition and ways to protect yourself. For example, masks or personal respirators may help protect you from antigens in the air. (A personal respirator is a device that helps filter the air you breathe in.)
                
Some people who have HP may need to move to a different home or change jobs to avoid antigens. After hurricanes, for example, some people have to move from their homes to avoid molds that could harm their lungs. However, moving and changing jobs sometimes isn't possible.
                
Medicines and Other Treatments
                
If you have chronic HP, your doctor may prescribe medicines called corticosteroids. These medicines reduce lung inflammation. Prednisone is an example of a corticosteroid.
                
Long-term use of prednisone, especially at high doses, can cause serious side effects. Thus, if your doctor prescribes this medicine, he or she may reduce the dose over time.
                
Examples of side effects from corticosteroids are increased risk of infections, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and osteoporosis (thinning of the skin and bones).
                
People who develop pulmonary fibrosis may need medicines, oxygen therapy, and/or pulmonary rehab. Pulmonary fibrosis is a condition in which tissue deep in your lungs becomes scarred over time.
                
If you smoke, try to quit. Smoking can make HP symptoms worse and lead to other lung diseases. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit.

NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/oxt,"Oxygen therapy is a treatment that provides you with extra oxygen, a gas that your body needs to work well. Normally, your lungs absorb oxygen from the air. However, some diseases and conditions can prevent you from getting enough oxygen.
                
Oxygen therapy may help you function better and be more active. Oxygen is supplied in a metal cylinder or other container. It flows through a tube and is delivered to your lungs in one of the following ways:
                
Through a nasal cannula, which consists of two small plastic tubes, or prongs, that are placed in both nostrils.
                
Through a face mask, which fits over your nose and mouth.
                
Through a small tube inserted into your windpipe through the front of your neck. Your doctor will use a needle or small incision (cut) to place the tube. Oxygen delivered this way is called transtracheal oxygen therapy.
                
Oxygen therapy can be done in a hospital, another medical setting, or at home. If you need oxygen therapy for a chronic (ongoing) disease or condition, you might receive home oxygen therapy.
                
Overview
                
To learn how oxygen therapy works, it helps to understand how your respiratory system works. This system is a group of organs and tissues that help you breathe. The respiratory system includes the airways and lungs.
                
The airways carry oxygen-rich air to your lungs. They also carry carbon dioxide (a waste gas) out of your lungs.
                
Air enters your body through your nose or mouth, which moistens and warms the air. The air then travels through your voice box and down your windpipe. The windpipe divides into two tubes called bronchi that enter your lungs.
                
Within your lungs, your bronchi branch into thousands of smaller, thinner tubes called bronchioles (BRONG-ke-ols). These tubes end in bunches of tiny round air sacs called alveoli (al-VEE-uhl-eye).
                
Each of the air sacs is covered in a mesh of tiny blood vessels called capillaries (KAP-ih-lare-ees). The capillaries connect to a network of arteries and veins that move blood throughout your body.
                
When air reaches the air sacs, the oxygen in the air passes through the air sac walls into the blood in the capillaries.
                
The oxygen-rich blood then travels to the heart through the pulmonary vein and its branches. The heart pumps the oxygen-rich blood to your organs. (For more information, go to the Health Topics How the Lungs Work article.)
                
Certain acute (short-term) and chronic (ongoing) diseases and conditions can affect the transfer of oxygen from the alveoli into the blood. Examples include pneumonia (nu-MO-ne-ah) and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).
                
Your doctor will decide whether you need oxygen therapy based on the results of tests, such as an arterial blood gas test and a pulse oximetry test. These tests measure how much oxygen is in your blood. A low oxygen level is a sign that you need oxygen therapy.
                
Oxygen is considered a medicine, so your doctor must prescribe it.
                
Outlook
                
Oxygen therapy helps many people function better and be more active. It also may help:
                
Decrease shortness of breath and fatigue (tiredness)
                
Improve sleep in some people who have sleep-related breathing disorders
                
Increase the lifespan of some people who have COPD
                
Although you may need oxygen therapy long term, it doesn't have to limit your daily routine. Portable oxygen units can make it easier for you to move around and do many daily activities. Talk with your doctor if you have questions about whether certain activities are safe for you.
                
A home equipment provider will work with you to make sure you have the supplies and equipment you need. Trained staff also will show you how to use the equipment correctly and safely.
                
Oxygen therapy generally is safe, but it can pose a fire hazard. To use your oxygen safely, follow the instructions you receive from your home equipment provider.",information,Oxygen Therapy,What is (are) Oxygen Therapy ?,Drugs

Otherwise, your doctor will decide whether you need oxygen therapy based on test results. An arterial blood gas test and a pulse oximetry test can measure the amount of oxygen in your blood.
                
For an arterial blood gas test, a small needle is inserted into an artery, usually in your wrist. A sample of blood is taken from the artery. The sample is then sent to a laboratory, where its oxygen level is measured.
                
For a pulse oximetry test, a small sensor is attached to your fingertip or toe. The sensor uses light to estimate how much oxygen is in your blood.
                
If the tests show that your blood oxygen level is low, your doctor may prescribe oxygen therapy. In the prescription, your doctor will include the number of liters of oxygen per minute that you need (oxygen flow rate). He or she also will include how often you need to use the oxygen (frequency of use).
                
Frequency of use includes when and for how long you should use the oxygen. Depending on your condition and blood oxygen level, you may need oxygen only at certain times, such as during sleep or while exercising.

Because oxygen poses a fire risk, you'll need to take certain safety steps. Oxygen isn't explosive, but it can worsen a fire. In the presence of oxygen, a small fire can quickly get out of control. Also, the cylinder that compressed oxygen gas comes in can explode if it's exposed to heat.
                
Your home equipment provider will give you a complete list of safety steps that you'll need to follow at home and in public. For example, while on oxygen, you should:
                
Never smoke or be around people who are smoking
                
Never use paint thinners, cleaning fluids, gasoline, aerosol sprays, and other flammable materials
                
Stay at least 5 feet away from gas stoves, candles, and other heat sources
                
When you're not using the oxygen, keep it in a large, airy room. Never store compressed oxygen gas cylinders and liquid oxygen containers in small, enclosed places, such as in closets, behind curtains, or under clothes.
                
Oxygen containers let off small amounts of oxygen. These small amounts can build up to harmful levels if they're allowed to escape into small spaces.",outlook,Oxygen Therapy,What is the outlook for Oxygen Therapy ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/oxt,"Oxygen therapy can cause complications and side effects. These problems might include a dry or bloody nose, skin irritation from the nasal cannula or face mask, fatigue (tiredness), and morning headaches.
                
If these problems persist, tell your doctor and home equipment provider. Depending on the problem, your doctor may need to change your oxygen flow rate or the length of time you're using the oxygen.
                
If nose dryness is a problem, your doctor may recommend a nasal spray or have a humidifier added to your oxygen equipment.
                
If you have an uncomfortable nasal cannula or face mask, your home equipment provider can help you find a device that fits better. Your provider also can recommend over-the-counter gels and devices that are designed to lessen skin irritation.
                
Complications from transtracheal oxygen therapy can be more serious. With this type of oxygen therapy, oxygen is delivered through a tube inserted into your windpipe through the front of your neck.
                
With transtracheal oxygen therapy:
                
Mucus balls might develop on the tube inside the windpipe. Mucus balls tend to form as a result of the oxygen drying out the airways. Mucus balls can cause coughing and clog the windpipe or tube.
                
Problems with the tube slipping or breaking.
                
Infection.
                
Injury to the lining of the windpipe.
                
Proper medical care and correct handling of the tube and other supplies may reduce the risk of complications.
                
Other Risks
                
In certain people, oxygen therapy may suppress the drive to breathe, affecting how well the respiratory system works. This is managed by adjusting the oxygen flow rate.
                
Oxygen poses a fire risk, so you'll need to take certain safety steps. Oxygen itself isn't explosive, but it can worsen a fire. In the presence of oxygen, a small fire can quickly get out of control. Also, the cylinder that compressed oxygen gas comes in might explode if exposed to heat.

NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/hvd,"Currently, no medicines can cure heart valve disease. However, lifestyle changes and medicines often can treat symptoms successfully and delay problems for many years. Eventually, though, you may need surgery to repair or replace a faulty heart valve.
                
The goals of treating heart valve disease might include:
                
Medicines
                
Repairing or replacing faulty valves
                
Lifestyle changes to treat other related heart conditions
                
Medicines
                
In addition to heart-healthy lifestyle changes, your doctor may prescribe medicines to:
                
Lower high blood pressure or high blood cholesterol.
                
Prevent arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats).
                
Thin the blood and prevent clots (if you have a man-made replacement valve). Doctors also prescribe these medicines for mitral stenosis or other valve defects that raise the risk of blood clots.
                
Treat coronary heart disease. Medicines for coronary heart disease can reduce your hearts workload and relieve symptoms.
                
Treatheart failure. Heart failure medicines widen blood vessels and rid the body of excess fluid.
                
Repairing or Replacing Heart Valves
                
Your doctor may recommend repairing or replacing your heart valve(s), even if your heart valve disease isnt causing symptoms. Repairing or replacing a valve can prevent lasting damage to your heart and sudden death.
                
The decision to repair or replace heart valves depends on many factors, including:
                
The severity of your valve disease
                
Whether you need heart surgery for other conditions, such as bypass surgery to treat coronary heart disease. Bypass surgery and valve surgery can be performed at the sametime.
                
Your age and general health
                
When possible, heart valve repair is preferred over heart valve replacement. Valve repair preserves the strength and function of the heart muscle. People who have valve repair also have a lower risk of infective endocarditis after the surgery, and they dont need to take blood-thinning medicines for the rest of their lives.
                
However, heart valve repair surgery is harder to do than valve replacement. Also, not all valves can be repaired. Mitral valves often can be repaired. Aortic and pulmonary valves often have to be replaced.
                
Repairing Heart Valves
                
Heart surgeons can repair heart valves by:
                
Adding tissue to patch holes or tears or to increase the support at the base of the valve
                
Removing or reshaping tissue so the valve can close tighter
                
Separating fused valve flaps
                
Sometimes cardiologists repair heart valves using cardiac catheterization. Although catheter procedures are less invasive than surgery, they may not work as well for some patients. Work with your doctor to decide whether repair is appropriate. If so, your doctor can advise you on the best procedure.
                
Heart valves that cannot open fully (stenosis) can be repaired with surgery or with a less invasive catheter procedure called balloon valvuloplasty. This procedure also is called balloonvalvotomy.
                
During the procedure, a catheter (thin tube) with a balloon at its tip is threaded through a blood vessel to the faulty valve in your heart. The balloon is inflated to help widen the opening of the valve. Your doctor then deflates the balloon and removes both it and the tube. Youre awake during the procedure, which usually requires an overnight stay in a hospital.
                
Balloon valvuloplasty relieves many symptoms of heart valve disease, but may not cure it. The condition can worsen over time. You still may need medicines to treat symptoms or surgery to repair or replace the faulty valve. Balloon valvuloplasty has a shorter recovery time than surgery. The procedure may work as well as surgery for some patients who have mitral valve stenosis. For these people, balloon valvuloplasty often is preferred over surgical repair or replacement.
                
Balloon valvuloplasty doesnt work as well as surgery for adults who have aortic valve stenosis. Doctors often use balloon valvuloplasty to repair valve stenosis in infants and children.
                
Replacing Heart Valves
                
Sometimes heart valves cant be repaired and must be replaced. This surgery involves removing the faulty valve and replacing it with a man-made or biological valve.
                
Biological valves are made from pig, cow, or human heart tissue and may have man-made parts as well. These valves are specially treated, so you wont need medicines to stop your body from rejecting the valve.
                
Man-made valves last longer than biological valves and usually dont have to be replaced. Biological valves usually have to be replaced after about 10 years, although newer ones may last 15years or longer. Unlike biological valves, however, man-made valves require you to take blood-thinning medicines for the rest of your life. These medicines prevent blood clots from forming on the valve. Blood clots can cause a heart attack or stroke. Man-made valves also raise your risk of infective endocarditis.
                
You and your doctor will decide together whether you should have a man-made or biological replacement valve.
                
If youre a woman of childbearing age or if youre athletic, you may prefer a biological valve so you dont have to take blood-thinning medicines. If youre elderly, you also may prefer a biological valve, as it will likely last for the rest of your life.
                
Ross Procedure
                
Doctors also can treat faulty aortic valves with the Ross procedure. During this surgery, your doctor removes your faulty aortic valve and replaces it with your pulmonary valve. Your pulmonary valve is then replaced with a pulmonary valve from a deceased humandonor.
                
This is more involved surgery than typical valve replacement, and it has a greater risk of complications. The Ross procedure may be especially useful for children because the surgically replaced valves continue to grow with the child. Also, lifelong treatment with blood-thinning medicines isnt required. But in some patients, one or both valves fail to work well within a few years of the surgery. Researchers continue to study the use of this procedure.
                
Other Approaches for Repairing and Replacing Heart Valves
                
Some forms of heart valve repair and replacement surgery are less invasive than traditional surgery. These procedures use smaller incisions (cuts) to reach the heart valves. Hospital stays for these newer types of surgery usually are 3 to 5 days, compared with a 5-day stay for traditional heart valve surgery.
                
New surgeries tend to cause less pain and have a lower risk of infection. Recovery time also tends to be shorter2to 4weeks versus 6to 8weeks for traditional surgery.
                
Transcatheter Valve Therapy
                
Interventional cardiologists perform procedures that involve threading clips or other devices to repair faulty heart valves using a catheter (tube) inserted through a large blood vessel. The clips or devices are used to reshape the valves and stop the backflow of blood. People who receive these clips recover more easily than people who have surgery. However, the clips may not treat backflow as well as surgery.
                
Doctors also may use a catheter to replace faulty aortic valves. This procedure is called transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). For this procedure, the catheter usually is inserted into an artery in the groin (upper thigh) and threaded to the heart. A deflated balloon with a folded replacement valve around it is at the end of the catheter.
                
Once the replacement valve is placed properly, the balloon is used to expand the new valve so it fits securely within the old valve. The balloon is then deflated, and the balloon and catheter are removed.
                
A replacement valve also can be inserted in an existing replacement valve that is failing. This is called a valve-in-valve procedure.
                
Lifestyle Changes to Treat Other Related Heart
                
To help treat heart conditions related to heart valve disease, your doctor may advise you to make heart-healthy lifestyle changes, such as:
                
Heart-healthy eating
                
Maintaining a healthy weight
                
Managing stress
                
Physical activity
                
Quitting smoking
                
Heart-Healthy Eating
                
Your doctor may recommend heart-healthy eating, which should include:
                
Fat-free or low-fat dairy products, such as skim milk
                
Fish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and trout, about twice a week
                
Fruits, such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes
                
Legumes, such as kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans
                
Vegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and carrots
                
Whole grains, such as oatmeal, brown rice, and corn tortillas
                
When following a heart-healthy diet, you should avoid eating:
                
A lot of red meat
                
Palm and coconut oils
                
Sugary foods and beverages
                
Two nutrients in your diet make blood cholesterol levels rise:
                
Saturated fatfound mostly in foods that come from animals
                
Trans fat (trans fatty acids)found in foods made with hydrogenated oils and fats, such as stick margarine; baked goods, such as cookies, cakes, and pies; crackers; frostings; and coffee creamers. Some trans fats also occur naturally in animal fats and meats.
                
Saturated fat raises your blood cholesterol more than anything else in your diet. When you follow a heart-healthy eating plan, only 5percent to 6percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. Food labels list the amounts of saturated fat. To help you stay on track, here are some examples:
                
AvocadosNot all fats are bad. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats actually help lower blood cholesterol levels. Some sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are:
                
Corn, sunflower, and soybean oils
                
Nuts and seeds, such as walnuts
                
Olive, canola, peanut, safflower, and sesame oils
                
Peanut butter
                
Salmon and trout
                
Tofu
                
Sodium
                
You should try to limit the amount of sodium that you eat. This means choosing and preparing foods that are lower in salt and sodium. Try to use low-sodium and no added salt foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. Food labels tell you what you need to know about choosing foods that are lower in sodium. Try to eat no more than 2,300milligrams of sodium a day. If you have high blood pressure, you may need to restrict your sodium intake even more.
                
Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension
                
Your doctor may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan if you have high blood pressure. The DASH eating plan focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and low in fat, cholesterol, and sodium and salt.
                
The DASH eating plan is a good heart-healthy eating plan, even for those who dont have high blood pressure. Read more about DASH.
                
Alcohol
                
Try to limit alcohol intake. Too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure and triglyceride levels, a type of fat found in the blood. Alcohol also adds extra calories, which may cause weightgain.
                
Men should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day. Women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day. One drink is:
                
12 ounces of beer
                
5 ounces of wine
                
1 ounces of liquor
                
Maintaining a Healthy Weight
                
Maintaining a healthy weight is important for overall health and can lower your risk for heart valve disease. Aim for a Healthy Weight by following a heart-healthy eating plan and keeping physically active.
                
Knowing your body mass index (BMI) helps you find out if youre a healthy weight in relation to your height and gives an estimate of your total body fat. To figure out your BMI, check out the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes online BMI calculator or talk to your doctor. A BMI:
                
Below 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight.
                
Between 18.5 and 24.9 is in the normal range.
                
Between 25.0 and 29.9 is considered overweight.
                
Of 30.0 or higher is considered obese.
                
A general goal to aim for is a BMI of less than 25. Your doctor or health care provider can help you set an appropriate BMI goal.
                
Measuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. If most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type2 diabetes. This risk may be higher with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. To learn how to measure your waist, visit Assessing Your Weight and Health Risk.
                
If youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. A loss of just 3 percent to 5 percent of your current weight can lower your triglycerides, blood glucose, and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Greater amounts of weight loss can improve blood pressure readings, lower LDL cholesterol, and increase HDL cholesterol.
                
Managing Stress
                
Learning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health. Consider healthy stress-reducing activities, such as:
                
A stress management program
                
Meditation
                
Physical activity
                
Relaxation therapy
                
Talking things out with friends or family
                
Physical Activity
                
Regular physical activity can lower many heart valve disease risk factors.
                
Everyone should try to participate in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2hours and 30minutes per week or vigorous aerobic exercise for 1hour and 15minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats faster and you use more oxygen than usual. The more active you are, the more you will benefit. Participate in aerobic exercise for at least 10minutes at a time spread throughout the week.
                
Talk with your doctor before you start a new exercise plan. Ask your doctor how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you.

Quitting Smoking
                
If you smoke or use tobacco, quit. Smoking can damage and tighten blood vessels and raise your risk for atherosclerosis and other health problems. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke. If you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking.

Prompt treatment of strep infections can prevent rheumatic fever, which damages the heartvalves.
                
Its possible that exercise, a heart-healthy diet, and medicines that lower cholesterol might prevent aortic stenosis (thickening and stiffening of the aortic valve). Researchers continue to study this possibility.

Not all fats are bad. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats actually help lower blood cholesterollevels.
                
Some sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are:
                
Avocados
                
Corn, sunflower, and soybean oils
                
Nuts and seeds, such as walnuts
                
Olive, canola, peanut, safflower, and sesame oils
                
Peanut butter
                
Salmon and trout
                
Tofu
                
Sodium
                
You should try to limit the amount of sodium that you eat. This means choosing and preparing foods that are lower in salt and sodium. Try to use low-sodium and no added salt foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking. Food labels tell you what you need to know about choosing foods that are lower in sodium. Try to eat no more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium a day. If you have high blood pressure, you may need to restrict your sodium intake even more.
                
Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension
                
Your doctor may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan if you have high blood pressure. The DASH eating plan focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other foods that are heart healthy and low in fat, cholesterol, and sodium and salt.
                
The DASH eating plan is a good heart-healthy eating plan, even for those who dont have high blood pressure. Read more about DASH.
                
Alcohol
                
Try to limit alcohol intake. Too much alcohol canraise your blood pressure and triglyceride levels, a type of fat found in the blood. Alcohol also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain.
                
Men should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day. Women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day. One drink is:
                
12 ounces of beer
                
5 ounces of wine
                
1 ounces of liquor
                
Maintaining a Healthy Weight
                
Maintaining a healthy weight is important for overall health and can lower your risk for coronary heart disease. Aim for a Healthy Weight by following a heart-healthy eating plan and keeping physically active.
                
Knowing your body mass index (BMI) helps you find out if youre a healthy weight in relation to your height and gives an estimate of your total body fat. To figure out your BMI, check out the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutes (NHLBI) online BMI calculator or talk to your doctor. A BMI:
                
Below 18.5 is a sign that you are underweight.
                
Between 18.5 and 24.9 is in the normal range.
                
Between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight.
                
Of 30 or more is considered obese.
                
A general goal to aim for is a BMI below 25. Your doctor or health care provider can help you set an appropriate BMI goal.
                
Measuring waist circumference helps screen for possible health risks. If most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, youre at a higher risk for heart disease and type 2 diabetes. This risk may be high with a waist size that is greater than 35 inches for women or greater than 40 inches for men. To learn how to measure your waist, visit Assessing Your Weight and Health Risk.
                
If youre overweight or obese, try to lose weight. A loss of just 3 percent to 5 percent of your current weight can lower your triglycerides, blood glucose, and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Greater amounts of weight loss can improve blood pressure readings, lower LDL cholesterol, and increase HDL cholesterol.
                
Managing Stress
                
Research shows that the most commonly reported trigger for a heart attack is an emotionally upsetting eventparticularly one involving anger. Also, some of the ways people cope with stresssuch as drinking, smoking, or overeatingarent healthy.
                
Learning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve your emotional and physical health. Consider healthy stress-reducing activities, such as:
                
A stress management program
                
Meditation
                
Physical activity
                
Relaxation therapy
                
Talking things out with friends or family
                
Physical Activity
                
Routine physical activity can lower many coronary heart disease risk factors, including LDL (bad) cholesterol, high blood pressure, and excess weight. Physical activity also can lower your risk for diabetes and raise your HDL cholesterol level. HDL is the good cholesterol that helps prevent coronary heart disease.
                
Everyone should try to participate in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise at least 2hours and 30minutes per week, or vigorous aerobic exercise for 1hour and 15minutes per week. Aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, is any exercise in which your heart beats faster and you use more oxygen than usual. The more active you are, the more you will benefit. Participate in aerobic exercise for at least 10minutes at a time spread throughout the week.

Physical Activity and Your Heart
                
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines forAmericans
                
Talk with your doctor before you start a new exercise plan. Ask your doctor how much and what kinds of physical activity are safe for you.
                
Quitting Smoking
                
If you smoke, quit. Smoking can raise your risk for coronary heart disease and heart attack and worsen other coronary heart disease risk factors. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke.
                
If you have trouble quitting smoking on your own, consider joining a support group. Many hospitals, workplaces, and community groups offer classes to help people quit smoking.

Learn more about heart disease and the traits, conditions, and habits that can raise your risk for developing it. Talk with your doctor about your risk factors for heart disease and how to controlthem.
                
If lifestyle changes arent enough, your doctor may prescribe medicines to control your risk factors. Take all of your medicines as your doctor advises. Visit your doctor regularly and have recommended testing.
                
Know your numbers. Ask your doctor for these three tests and have the results explained toyou:
                
Blood pressure measurement.
                
Fasting blood glucose. This test is for diabetes.
                
Lipoprotein panel. This test measures total cholesterol, LDL (bad) cholesterol, HDL (good) cholesterol, and triglycerides (a type of fat in the blood).

NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/shock,"Cardiogenic shock is life threatening and requires emergency medical treatment. The condition usually is diagnosed after a person has been admitted to a hospital for a heart attack. If the person isn't already in a hospital, emergency treatment can start as soon as medical personnel arrive.
                
The first goal of emergency treatment for cardiogenic shock is to improve the flow of blood and oxygen to the bodys organs.
                
Sometimes both the shock and its cause are treated at the same time. For example, doctors may quickly open a blocked blood vessel that's damaging the heart. Often, this can get the patient out of shock with little or no additional treatment.
                
Emergency Life Support
                
Emergency life support treatment is needed for any type of shock. This treatment helps get oxygen-rich blood flowing to the brain, kidneys, and other organs.
                
Restoring blood flow to the organs keeps the patient alive and may prevent long-term damage to the organs. Emergency life support treatment includes:
                
Giving the patient extra oxygen to breathe so that more oxygen reaches the lungs, the heart, and the rest of the body.
                
Providing breathing support if needed. A ventilator might be used to protect the airway and provide the patient with extra oxygen. A ventilator is a machine that supports breathing.
                
Giving the patient fluids, including blood and blood products, through a needle inserted in a vein (when the shock is due to blood loss). This can help get more blood to major organs and the rest of the body. This treatment usually isnt used for cardiogenic shock because the heart can't pump the blood that's already in the body. Also, too much fluid is in the lungs, making it hard to breathe.
                
Medicines
                
During and after emergency life support treatment, doctors will try to find out whats causing the shock. If the reason for the shock is that the heart isn't pumping strongly enough, then the diagnosis is cardiogenic shock.
                
Treatment for cardiogenic shock will depend on its cause. Doctors may prescribe medicines to:
                
Prevent blood clots from forming
                
Increase the force with which the heart muscle contracts
                
Treat a heart attack
                
Medical Devices
                
Medical devices can help the heart pump and improve blood flow. Devices used to treat cardiogenic shock may include:
                
An intra-aortic balloon pump. This device is placed in the aorta, the main blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the body. A balloon at the tip of the device is inflated and deflated in a rhythm that matches the hearts pumping rhythm. This allows the weakened heart muscle to pump as much blood as it can, which helps get more blood to vital organs, such as the brain and kidneys.
                
A left ventricular assist device (LVAD). This device is a battery-operated pump that takes over part of the hearts pumping action. An LVAD helps the heart pump blood to the body. This device may be used if damage to the left ventricle, the hearts main pumping chamber, is causing shock.
                
Medical Procedures and Surgery
                
Sometimes medicines and medical devices aren't enough to treat cardiogenic shock.
                
Medical procedures and surgery can restore blood flow to the heart and the rest of the body, repair heart damage, and help keep a patient alive while he or she recovers from shock.
                
Surgery also can improve the chances of long-term survival. Surgery done within 6 hours of the onset of shock symptoms has the greatest chance of improving survival.
                
The types of procedures and surgery used to treat underlying causes of cardiogenic shock include:
                
Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and stents. PCI,also known as coronary angioplasty,is a procedure used to open narrowed or blocked coronary (heart) arteries and treat an ongoing heart attack. A stent is a small mesh tube that's placed in a coronary artery during PCI to help keep it open.
                
Coronary artery bypass grafting. For this surgery, arteries or veins from other parts of the body are used to bypass (that is, go around) narrowed coronary arteries. This creates a new passage for oxygen-rich blood to reach the heart.
                
Surgery to repair damaged heart valves.
                
Surgery to repair a break in the wall that separates the hearts chambers. This break is called a septal rupture.
                
Heart transplant. This type of surgery rarely is done during an emergency situation like cardiogenic shock because of other available options. Also, doctors need to do very careful testing to make sure a patient will benefit from a heart transplant and to find a matching heart from a donor. Still, in some cases, doctors may recommend a transplant if they feel it's the best way to improve a patient's chances of long-term survival.",treatment,Cardiogenic Shock,What are the treatments for Cardiogenic Shock ?,Drugs
NHLBI,http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/shock,"The best way to prevent cardiogenic shock is to lower your risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) and heart attack. (For more information, go to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's ""Your Guide to a Healthy Heart."")
                
If you already have CHD, its important to get ongoing treatment from a doctor who has experience treating heart problems.
                
If you have a heart attack, you should get treatment right away to try to prevent cardiogenic shock and other possible complications.
                
Act in time. Know the warning signs of a heart attack so you can act fast to get treatment. Many heart attack victims wait 2 hours or more after their symptoms begin before they seek medical help. Delays in treatment increase the risk of complications and death.
                
If you think you're having a heart attack, call 911 for help. Don't drive yourself or have friends or family drive you to the hospital.

Glucosamine also exists in other places in nature. For example, glucosamine sulfate used in dietary supplements is often obtained from the shells of shellfish. Glucosamine sulfate used in dietary supplements does not always come from natural sources. It can also be made in a laboratory.

There are different forms of glucosamine including glucosamine sulfate, glucosamine hydrochloride, and N-acetyl glucosamine. These different chemicals have some similarities, but they may not have the same effects when taken as a dietary supplement. Most of the scientific research on glucosamine has involved glucosamine sulfate. See separate listings for glucosamine hydrochloride or N-acetyl glucosamine.

Dietary supplements that contain glucosamine often contain additional ingredients. These additional ingredients are frequently chondroitin sulfate, methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), or shark cartilage. Some people think these combinations work better than taking just glucosamine sulfate alone. So far, researchers have found no proof that combining the additional ingredients with glucosamine adds any benefit.

Some glucosamine sulfate products are not labeled accurately. In some cases, the amount of glucosamine actually in the product has varied from none to over 100% of the amount stated on the product's label. Some products have contained glucosamine hydrochloride when glucosamine sulfate was listed on the label.

Osteoarthritis. Most research shows that taking glucosamine sulfate can provide some pain relief for people with osteoarthritis, especially those with osteoarthritis of the knees.  For some people, glucosamine sulfate might work as well as over-the-counter and prescription pain medications such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen; however, pain medications work quickly while glucosamine sulfate can take 4-8 weeks before it provides pain relief.  Also, people who take glucosamine sulfate often still need to take pain medications for pain flare-ups.
  
In addition to relieving pain, glucosamine sulfate might also slow the breakdown of joints and prevent the condition from getting worse if it is taken for several years. Some research shows that people who take glucosamine sulfate might be less likely to need total knee replacement surgery.

There are several kinds of glucosamine products.  The most research showing benefit is for products that contain glucosamine sulfate.  Products that contain glucosamine hydrochloride do not seem to work as well.  Many products contain both glucosamine with chondroitin, but there is no evidence that these products work any better than glucosamine sulfate by itself. 

Glucosamine sulfate does not seem to prevent people from getting osteoarthritis.

Heart disease. People who take glucosamine might have a lower risk of developing heart disease. But it's unclear what dose or form of glucosamine might work best. Other forms of glucosamine include glucosamine hydrochloride and N-acetyl glucosamine. It's also unclear if this lower risk is from glucosamine or from following healthier lifestyle habits.

But this product doesn't seem to help joint stiffness or function. Other early research shows that taking 1500 mg of glucosamine sulfate daily for 28 days does not reduce knee pain in athletes following a knee injury. However, it does seem to improve knee movement. 
Multiple sclerosis (MS). Early research shows that taking 1000 mg of glucosamine sulfate by mouth daily for 6 months might reduce the relapse of multiple sclerosis. 
Recovery after surgery. Early research shows that taking glucosamine sulfate does not improve function, pain, and performance in male athletes who had surgery to fix a torn ACL. The ACL is a ligament that holds the knee in place during movement.
Stroke. People who take glucosamine might have a slightly lower risk of having a stroke. But it's unclear what dose or form of glucosamine might work best. Other forms of glucosamine include glucosamine hydrochloride and N-acetyl glucosamine. It's also unclear if this lower risk is from glucosamine or from following healthier lifestyle habits.
Jaw pain (Temporomandibular disorder). Some research shows that taking glucosamine sulfate works about as well as the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil, etc.) for relieving jaw pain. In some people, pain relief appears to continue for up to 90 days after glucosamine sulfate is discontinued.

MPlusHerbsSupplements,https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/828.html,"When taken by mouth:Yerba mate is POSSIBLY SAFE for most people when taken for short periods of time. Yerba mate contains caffeine, which in some people can cause side effects such as inability to sleep (insomnia), nervousness and restlessness, upset stomach, nausea and vomiting, increased heart rate and breathing, and other side effects.

Yerba mate is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when taken in large amounts or for long periods of time. Consuming large amounts of yerba mate (more than 12 cups daily) might cause headache, anxiety, agitation, ringing in the ears, and irregular heartbeats. Drinking large amounts of yerba mate (1-2 liters daily) also increases the risk of esophageal cancer, kidney cancer, stomach cancer, bladder cancer, cervical cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, and possibly laryngeal or mouth cancer. This risk is especially high for people who smoke or drink alcohol.

Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Yerba mate is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when taken by mouth during pregnancy. One concern is that using yerba mate seems to increase the risk of getting cancer. It's not known whether that risk is transferred to the developing fetus. Another concern is the caffeine content of yerba mate. Caffeine crosses the placenta and enters the fetus' bloodstream, producing caffeine levels in the fetus that resemble the caffeine level in the mother. In general, mothers should avoid consuming more than 300 mg of caffeine daily; that's about 6 cups of yerba mate. Infants born to mothers who consume a lot of caffeine during pregnancy sometimes show symptoms of caffeine withdrawal after birth. High doses of caffeine have also been linked with miscarriage, premature delivery, and low birth weight. However, researchers studied mothers who drank yerba mate tea during pregnancy and found no strong link between drinking yerba mate and premature delivery or small birth weight. But this study has been criticized because it did not consider the amount of yerba mate or caffeine used by the mothers; it looked only at how often they used yerba mate.

Yerba mate is also POSSIBLY UNSAFE during breast-feeding. It is not known whether the cancer-causing chemicals in yerba mate pass into breast milk, but that is a concern. The caffeine in yerba mate is also a problem. It might cause irritability and increased bowel movements in nursing infants.
Children: Yerba mate is POSSIBLY UNSAFE for children when taken by mouth. Yerba mate is linked with an increased risk of esophageal cancer, kidney cancer, stomach cancer, bladder cancer, cervical cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, and possibly laryngeal or mouth cancer.
Alcoholism: Heavy alcohol use combined with long-term yerba mate use increases the risk of cancer from 3-fold to 7-fold.
Anxiety disorders: The caffeine in yerba mate might make anxiety disorders worse.
Bleeding disorders: Caffeine might slow clotting. As a result, there is a concern that the caffeine in yerba mate might make bleeding disorders worse. But so far, this effect has not been reported in people.
Heart conditions: Caffeine in yerba mate can cause irregular heartbeats in certain people. If you have a heart condition, discuss using yerba mate with your healthcare provider.
Diabetes: Some research shows that the caffeine in yerba mate may affect the way people with diabetes process sugar and may complicate blood sugar control. There is also some interesting research that shows caffeine may make the warning symptoms of low blood sugar in people with type 1 diabetes more noticeable. Some studies show that the symptoms of low blood sugar are more intense when they start in the absence of caffeine, but as low blood sugar continues, symptoms are greater with caffeine. This might increase the ability of people with diabetes to detect and treat low blood sugar. However, the downside is that caffeine might actually increase the number of low-sugar episodes. If you have diabetes, talk with your healthcare provider before using yerba mate.
Diarrhea: Yerba mate contains caffeine. The caffeine in yerba mate, especially when taken in large amounts, can worsen diarrhea.
Glaucoma: Using yerba mate increases the pressure inside the eye due to the caffeine it contains. The increase in pressure occurs within 30 minutes and lasts for at least 90 minutes. If you have glaucoma, discuss your use of yerba mate with your healthcare provider.
High blood pressure: Yerba mate contains caffeine. Drinking caffeine might increase blood pressure in people with high blood pressure. However, this effect might be less in people who drink caffeine regularly.  
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): Yerba mate contains caffeine. The caffeine in yerba mate, especially when taken in large amounts, can worsen diarrhea and might worsen symptoms of IBS.
Weak bones (osteoporosis): Some researchers have found that postmenopausal women who drink 4 cups or more daily of a traditional South American yerba mate tea have higher bone density. But other research shows that yerba mate might not have any effect on the bones of postmenopausal women. Also, the caffeine in yerba mate tends to flush calcium out of the body in the urine. This can contribute to weak bones. If you have osteoporosis, limit caffeine consumption to less than 300 mg per day (approximately 6 cups of yerba mate). Taking extra calcium may help to make up for the calcium that is flushed out. If you are generally healthy and getting enough calcium from your food and supplements, taking up to 400 mg of caffeine daily (about 8-10 cups of yerba mate) doesn't seem to increase the risk of getting osteoporosis. Postmenopausal women who have an inherited condition that keeps them from processing vitamin D normally, should be especially cautious when using caffeine.

There are some women who are at special risk for weak bones. These women have an inherited condition that makes it hard for them to use vitamin D properly. Vitamin D works with calcium to build strong bones. These women should be especially careful to limit the amount of caffeine they get from yerba mate as well as other sources.
Smoking: The risk of getting cancer is 3 to 7 times higher in people who smoke and use yerba mate for long periods of time.

Creatine is most commonly used for improving exercise performance and increasing muscle mass in athletes and older adults. There is some science supporting the use of creatine in improving the athletic performance of young, healthy people during brief high-intensity activity such as sprinting. Because of this, creatine is often used as a dietary supplement to improve muscle strength and athletic performance. In the U.S., a majority of sports nutrition supplements, which total $2.7 billion in annual sales, contain creatine.

Creatine use is allowed by the International Olympic Committee, National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), and professional sports.

In addition to improving athletic performance and muscle strength, creatine is taken by mouth for muscle cramps, multiple sclerosis (MS), depression, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.

Athletic performance. Creatine seems to help improve rowing performance, jumping height, and soccer performance in athletes. But the effect of creatine on sprinting, cycling, or swimming performance varies. The mixed results may relate to the small sizes of the studies, the differences in creatine doses, and differences in test used to measure performance. Creatine doesn't seem to improve serving ability in tennis players.
Disorders of creatine metabolism or transport. Some people have a disorder that prevents their body from making creatine. This can lead to low levels of creatine in the brain. Low levels of creatine in the brain can lead to decreased mental function, seizures, autism, and movement problems. Taking creatine by mouth daily for up to 3 years can increase creatine levels in the brain in children and young adults with a disorder of creatine production called guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT) deficiency. This can help improve movement and reduce seizures. But it doesn't improve mental ability. Arginine-glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) deficiency is another disorder that prevents the body from making creatine. In children with this condition, taking creatine for up to 8 years seems to improve attention, language, and mental performance. But taking creatine does not seem to improve brain creatine levels, movement, or mental function in children who have a disorder in which creatine isn't transported properly. 
Muscle strength. There is a lot of mixed research on creatine's ability to improve muscle strength. However, analyses of this research show that creatine seems to modestly improve upper body strength and lower body strength in both younger and older adults.
Age-related muscle loss (sarcopenia ). Creatine may help improve muscle strength in older adults. It seems to work best when used along with exercise to build muscles. It doesn't seem to help when used in lower doses, as a single dose, or when used without exercise.
Possibly ineffective for...
Lou Gehrig's disease (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or ALS). Taking creatine by mouth does not seem to slow disease progression or improve survival in people with ALS.
An inherited brain disorder that affects movements, emotions, and thinking (Huntington disease). Research suggests that taking creatine by mouth daily for 2 years does not improve muscle strength, coordination, or symptoms in people with Huntington's disease.
Low bone mass (osteopenia). Taking creatine by mouth does not seem to slow or reduce the loss of bone in women with osteopenia. 
Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Long-term kidney disease (chronic kidney disease or CKD). Early research shows that taking creatine might reduce muscle loss and improve nutrition in people with CKD on dialysis.  
A lung disease that makes it harder to breathe (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD). Early research on the effects of creatine in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is inconsistent. Some research suggests that taking creatine daily does not improve lung function. However, other research suggests that taking creatine may improve lung function or exercise capacity. 
Heart failure and fluid build up in the body (congestive heart failure or CHF). Some early research shows that taking creatine daily for 5-10 days improves muscle strength and endurance but does not improve symptoms of heart failure. Taking lower doses of creatine daily for 6 months does not improve exercise capacity or heart failure symptoms in men. 
Depression. Early research suggests that taking creatine daily for 8 weeks enhances the effects of the antidepressant drug escitalopram in women with major depressive disorder. 
Diabetes. Early research shows that taking creatine by mouth for 5 days reduces blood sugar after eating in people with newly diagnosed diabetes. However, the effects of taking creatine for longer than 5 days in people with diabetes are not know. 
Fatigue. Taking creatine might improve accuracy on mental tasks in people with mental fatigue. But it doesn't seem to help people respond more quickly. 
Fibromyalgia. Early research suggests that taking 5 grams of creatine four times daily for 5 days followed by 5 grams daily for 16 weeks improves strength in women with fibromyalgia. But creatine does not seem to improve aerobic exercise capacity, pain, sleep, quality of life, or mental function in people with fibromyalgia. 
An inherited disorder marked by vision loss (gyrate atrophy). Early research shows that creatine deficiency, which has been associated with this form of vision loss, can be corrected with supplements. Taking creatine daily for one year seems to slow eye damage and vision loss. 
High levels of homocysteine in the blood (hyperhomocysteinemia). Early research show that taking creatine for 3 weeks reduces levels of homocysteine in vegans with hyperhomocysteinemia. 
A group of inherited disorders that leads to muscle weakness and numbness in the arms and legs. Early research in people with inherited nerve damage diseases such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease, suggest that taking creatine by mouth daily for between one and 12 weeks has no effect on muscle strength or endurance. 
Rare, inherited disorders causing muscle weakness (idiopathic inflammatory myopathies). Early studies suggest taking creatine might produce small improvements in muscle strength in people with these conditions. 
A rare, inherited disorder that causes muscle pain and cramping (McArdle disease). Some early research suggests that taking creatine by mouth daily improves muscle function in some people with McArdle disease. However, taking higher doses of creatine seem to make muscle pain worse. 
A group of disorders that most often cause muscle weakness (mitochondrial myopathies). Early research suggests that taking creatine by mouth does not improve muscle function or quality of life in people with mitochondrial myopathies. However, creatine might improve some measures of muscle strength. 
Multiple sclerosis (MS). Early research suggests that taking creatine by mouth daily for 5 days does not improve exercise ability in people with multiple sclerosis. 
Muscle breakdown. Taking creatine by mouth daily does not seem to increase muscle mass or strength in men with muscle loss due to HIV. However, taking creatine seems to help maintain muscle mass and reduce the loss of muscle strength that is associated with having to wear a cast. 
Muscle cramps. Early research shows that taking creatine by mouth before hemodialysis treatments seems to reduce muscle cramps. 
A group of inherited disorders that cause muscle weakness and muscle loss (muscular dystrophy). Early research on the use of creatine by mouth in people with muscular dystrophy is not clear. Some evidence shows that muscle strength and fatigue seem to improve after taking creatine daily for 8-16 weeks. However, other research suggests that creatine provides no benefit for people with muscular dystrophy. 
Pauses in breathing that may be followed by low heart rate and low oxygen levels in newborns. Early research shows that giving creatine to premature infants does not improve breathing problems while sleeping. 
Injury to the brain, spine, or nerves (neurological trauma). Early research shows that taking creatine by mouth daily for 7 days increases the ability to exercise by increasing lung function in people with a spinal cord injury. However, other research shows that creatine does not improve wrist muscle or hand function. Early research also shows that taking creatine by mouth daily for 6 months reduces amnesia following a traumatic brain injury in children. 
Osteoarthritis. Early research suggests that taking creatine by mouth daily in combination with strengthening exercises improves physical functioning in postmenopausal women with knee osteoarthritis. 
Parkinson disease. Early research suggests that taking creatine twice daily for 12-18 months slows the progression of Parkinson disease in people who have not yet started conventional medicines. 
Recovery after surgery. Early research shows that taking creatine daily doesn't improve recovery of muscle strength after surgery. 
An inherited disorder the affects brain development in girls (Rett syndrome). Early research suggests that taking creatine daily for 6 months can slightly improve symptoms in females with Rett syndrome. 
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Early research shows that taking creatine by mouth daily increases lean muscle mass and may improve muscle strength, but does not improve physical functioning in adults with rheumatoid arthritis. In children, taking a specific supplement  containing creatine and fatty acids twice daily for 30 days might reduce pain and swelling. But the effects of creatine alone are not clear. 
Schizophrenia. Early research shows that taking creatine by mouth daily for 2 months does not improve symptoms or mental function in people with schizophrenia. 
An inherited disorder that causes muscle weakness and wasting (spinal muscular atrophy). Early research suggests that children with muscle loss in the spine do not benefit from taking creatine by mouth.

Doses up to 25 grams daily for up to 14 days have been safely used. Lower doses up to 4-5 grams taken daily for up to 18 months have also been safely used. Creatine is POSSIBLY SAFE when taken by mouth, long-term. Doses up to 10 grams daily for up to 5 years have been safely used in research. 

Creatine can cause stomach pain, nausea, diarrhea, and muscle cramping.

Creatine causes muscles to draw water from the rest of your body. Be sure to drink extra water to make up for this. Also, if you are taking creatine, don't exercise in the heat. It might cause you to become dehydrated.

Many people who use creatine gain weight. This is because creatine causes the muscles to hold water, not because it actually builds muscle.

There is concern that creatine might cause irregular heartbeat in some people. But more information is needed to know if creatine can cause this problem.

Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: There is not enough reliable information about the safety of taking creatine if you are pregnant or breast feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.
Children: Creatine is POSSIBLY SAFE in children when taken by mouth, short-term. Creatine 3-5 grams daily for 2-6 months has been taken safely in children 5-18 years of age. Creatine 2 grams daily for 6 months has been taken safely in children 2-5 years of age. Additionally, creatine 0.1-0.4 grams/kg daily for up to 6 months has been taken safely in both infants and children.

Drinking black tea and other caffeinated beverages throughout the day helps to keep people alert and improve attention, even after extended periods without sleep. The effect appears to increase with increasing amount of caffeine in the caffeinated beverages.Possibly effective for...
Low blood pressure.  Black tea contains caffeine. Drinking beverages containing caffeine helps increase blood pressure in older people who have low blood pressure after eating.
Heart attack. Some research shows that people who drink black tea have a lower risk of having a heart attack. Also, people who have been drinking black tea for at least a year before having a heart attack seem to be less likely to die after having a heart attack.
Weak and brittle bones (osteoporosis).  Early research suggests that older women who drink more black tea have stronger bones than those who drink less. Drinking more black tea also seems to be linked with a lower risk of hip fracture in older men and women.
Ovarian cancer. Women who regularly drink tea, including black tea or green tea, appear to have a lower risk of developing ovarian cancer compared to women who never or rarely drink tea.
Parkinson disease. Some research shows that people who drink caffeinated beverages such as coffee, tea, and cola have a lower risk of Parkinson disease.

Foot sores in people with diabetes. Most research shows that applying dressings containing honey to diabetic foot ulcers seems to reduce healing time and prevent the need for antibiotics. But not all research agrees.
Dry eye. Using specific honey eye drops or eye gel in the eyes (Optimel Manuka plus eye drops or Optimel Antibacterial Manuka Eye Gel) helps to make dry eyes feel better. These products can be used along with regular dry eye treatment such as lubricant drops and warm cloths on the eyes.
A skin condition that causes redness on the face (rosacea). Research shows that applying a topical honey product to the skin might improve symptoms of rosacea.
Swelling (inflammation) and sores inside the mouth (oral mucositis).

Sores and ulcers of the mouth and gums caused by herpes virus (herpetic gingivostomatitis). Rinsing the mouth and then slowly swallowing honey helps sores and ulcers in the mouth from the herpes virus heal faster in children also given a medication called acyclovir. 
Wound healing. Applying honey preparations directly to wounds or using dressings containing honey seems to improve healing. Several small studies describe the use of honey or honey-soaked dressings for various types of wounds, including wounds after surgery, chronic leg ulcers, abscesses, burns, abrasions, cuts, and places where skin was taken for grafting.

Athletic performance. Early research suggests that honey might improve blood levels following exercise and improve performance when given during exercise.
Infections in people with catheters. Most early research suggests that applying honey, usually manuka honey to the exit sites of certain types of implanted hemodialysis catheters prevents infections from developing as effectively as certain antibiotics or antiseptics. But other research shows that applying Manuka honey at the exit site doesn't reduce the occurrence of these infections. In fact, it might increase the risk of infection in people with diabetes.
Diabetes. Some early research shows that eating large doses of honey each day can decrease cholesterol levels in people with type 2 diabetes. But it also seems to increase HbA1c, a measure of average blood sugar levels. Other early research shows that ingesting smaller amounts of honey each day can decrease fasting blood sugar and cholesterol levels in people with type 1 diabetes.

But another study shows that adding honey to a solution used to treat dehydration decreases diarrhea in only infants and children with stomach flu caused by bacteria. It might not benefit those with stomach flu caused by a virus or other parasite.
Menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhea). Early research shows that eating honey every day before starting a period helps to reduce pain once it starts. 
A mild form of gum disease (gingivitis). Early research suggests that chewing ""leather"" made from manuka honey slightly reduces plaque and gum bleeding compared to sugarless chewing gum in people with gingivitis.
Hemorrhoids. Early research suggests that applying a spoonful of a mixture containing honey, olive oil, and beeswax reduces bleeding and itching caused by hemorrhoids.
Cold sores (herpes labialis). Early research suggests that applying a dressing soaked with honey four times daily improves symptoms and healing time of cold sores.
High levels of cholesterol or other fats (lipids) in the blood (hyperlipidemia). Some early research shows that taking 75 grams of honey per day for 14 days lowers low-density lipoprotein (LDL or ""bad"") cholesterol in women with high cholesterol. But other early research shows that taking 70 grams of honey per day for 30 days does not lower cholesterol levels in people with normal or high cholesterol levels.

Inability to become pregnant within a year of trying to conceive (infertility). Early research suggests that applying a combination of Egyptian bee honey and royal jelly in the vagina increases pregnancy rates for couples having difficulty getting pregnant due to male infertility.
Skin infection caused by Leishmania parasites (Leishmania lesions). Early research suggests that covering sores with honey-soaked dressings twice daily for 6 weeks in addition to medication injections results in slower healing than medications alone.
A condition caused by a poor diet or the body's inability to absorb nutrients. Early research suggests that honey improves weight and other symptoms in infants and children with poor nutrition.
Flesh-eating disease (necrotizing fasciitis). Early research has shown unclear results about the effects of honey dressings, when used with antibiotics, as a treatment for a type of flesh-eating disease that causes gangrene around the genitals. 
Pain after surgery. Honey might reduce pain and need for pain medication in children having their tonsils out.

Some early research suggests that taking cannabidiol four times daily for 4 weeks improves psychotic symptoms and might be as effective as the antipsychotic medication amisulpride. However, other early research suggests that taking cannabidiol for 14 days is not beneficial. The conflicting results might be related to the cannabidiol dose used and duration of treatment.
Quitting smoking. Early research suggests that inhaling cannabidiol with an inhaler for one week might reduce the number of cigarettes smoked by about 40% compared to baseline.
A type of anxiety marked by fear in some or all social settings (social anxiety disorder). Some early research shows that taking cannabidiol 300 mg daily does not improve anxiety during public speaking in people with social anxiety disorder. But it might help with public speaking in people who don't have social anxiety disorder. It might also help with general social anxiety. Also, some research suggests that taking a higher dose (400-600 mg) may improve anxiety associated with public speaking or medical imaging testing.

MPlusHerbsSupplements,https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/554.html,"Lycopene is a naturally occurring chemical that gives fruits and vegetables a red color. It is one of a number of pigments called carotenoids. Lycopene is found in tomatoes, watermelons, red oranges, pink grapefruits, apricots, rosehips, and guavas. In North America, 85% of dietary lycopene comes from tomato products such as ketchup, tomato juice, sauce, or paste. A serving of fresh tomatoes contains between 4 mg and 10 mg of lycopene, while one cup (240 mL) of tomato juice provides about 20 mg. Processing raw tomatoes using heat (in the making of tomato juice, tomato paste or ketchup, for example) actually changes the lycopene in the raw product into a form that is easier for the body to use. The lycopene in supplements is about as easy for the body to use as lycopene found in food.

Lycopene is used for high blood pressure, high cholesterol, cancer, and many other conditions but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.

Bladder cancer. People who get more lycopene in their diet don't seem to have a lower risk for bladder cancer.
Diabetes. People who get more lycopene in their diet don't seem to have a lower risk of developing diabetes.
Parkinson disease. People who get more lycopene in their diet don't seem to have a lower risk of Parkinson disease. 

Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
An eye disease that leads to vision loss in older adults (age-related macular degeneration or AMD). It's unclear if lycopene reduces the risk of AMD. Some research has found that people with low lycopene levels are almost twice as likely to develop AMD compared to people with high levels. But not all research agrees.
Lou Gehrig's disease (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or ALS). Lycopene is a type of carotenoid. People who get more carotenoids in their diet seem to have a lower risk of ALS. But diets specifically rich in lycopene alone don't seem to be linked with a lower risk of ALS.
Asthma. Early research shows that taking a product containing lycopene doesn't prevent asthma flare-ups in people with stable asthma. But it might improve lung function after exercise in people with asthma who tend to have flare-ups after exercise.
Hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis). There is some evidence that higher lycopene blood levels are associated with a reduced risk of hardening of the arteries. There is also early evidence that higher lycopene blood levels can reduce the risk of heart disease associated with hardening of the arteries. However, there does not appear to be a link between lycopene levels and stroke risk.
Enlarged prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH). Early research shows that taking lycopene can slow the rate of prostate growth and can improve symptoms in people with this condition. However, other research found no link between lycopene intake in the diet and the development of an enlarged prostate.
Breast cancer. Research about how lycopene affects breast cancer risk is inconsistent. Some evidence suggests that having higher lycopene blood levels is associated with a lower risk of breast cancer. However, other research shows that neither lycopene intake nor lycopene blood levels are linked to breast cancer risk.
Heart disease. Early research links higher levels of lycopene in the blood and in the diet to reduced risk of developing heart disease or having a heart attack or stroke. Research also shows that taking a lycopene supplement does not reduce most risk factors for heart diseases, such as high blood pressure or high cholesterol. It's not known if taking a lycopene supplement reduces the risk of heart disease-related events such as stroke or heart attack.
Cataracts. One study suggests that higher lycopene blood levels are associated with a lower risk of developing cataracts. However, other studies have found no link between lycopene intake or lycopene blood levels and the risk of developing cataracts.
Cancer of the cervix. Research about how lycopene affects the risk of cervical cancer is inconsistent. Some evidence suggests that higher lycopene blood levels or higher lycopene intake in the diet is linked to a lower risk of cervical cancer. Other studies have not found this link.
A condition that causes persistent pelvic pain, urinary problems, and sexual problems (Chronic prostatitis and chronic pelvic pain syndrome). Taking a product containing lycopene, selenium, and saw palmetto for 8 weeks may reduce pain in men with prostate swelling and pelvic pain better than taking saw palmetto alone. It's unclear if this benefit is due to lycopene, other ingredients, or the combination.
Colon cancer, rectal cancer. Some research has found that diets rich in lycopene are linked with a decreased risk of colon and rectal cancer. But other research has found no link between lycopene intake in the diet and the risk of colon and rectal cancer.
Cancer of the esophagus. Early research has found that diets rich in lycopene are linked with a decreased risk of esophageal cancer.
Muscle damage caused by exercise. Early research shows that taking a combination of lycopene and other ingredients can reduce the muscle damage that occurs with a 2-hour long-distance run.
Brain tumor. Early research shows that taking lycopene by mouth for 3 months does not improve the response to radiotherapy and chemotherapy in people with brain tumors.
A mild form of gum disease (gingivitis). The effects of lycopene on gingivitis are unclear. Some research shows that taking lycopene for 2 weeks or receiving a shot of lycopene gel into the gums reduces gum disease. But other research shows no benefit.
A digestive tract infection that can lead to ulcers (Helicobacter pylori or H. pylori). Early research shows that taking lycopene along with antibiotics does not help treat H. pylori infection compared to taking antibiotics alone.
A sexually transmitted infection that can lead to genital warts or cancer (human papillomavirus or HPV). Women with higher levels of lycopene in their blood seem to recover from cancer-associated HPV infection faster than women with lower lycopene blood levels.
High levels of cholesterol or other fats (lipids) in the blood (hyperlipidemia). Early research shows that taking lycopene for 6 months lowers total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL or ""bad"") cholesterol, and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL or ""good"") cholesterol. However, other evidence suggests that lycopene does not affect cholesterol levels in adults with heart disease.
High blood pressure. Early research shows that taking lycopene daily for 8 weeks might lower blood pressure in people with high blood pressure. However, lycopene doesn't seem to help people with borderline high blood pressure.
Lung cancer. Research about how lycopene affects the risk of lung cancer is inconsistent. Some research shows that lower lycopene intake in the diet is linked to an increased risk of lung cancer. However, other research suggests that there is no link between lycopene consumption in the diet or lycopene blood levels and lung cancer risk.
Conditions in a man that prevent him from getting a woman pregnant within a year of trying to conceive (male infertility). Early research shows that taking lycopene by mouth daily for 3 months improves sperm quality in some men with fertility problems due to unknown causes.
Symptoms of menopause. Early research shows that taking a specific product containing lycopene, calcium, vitamin D3, astaxanthin, and citrus bioflavonoids daily for 8 weeks reduces menopausal symptoms including hot flashes, joint pain, anxiety, and depression.
White patches inside the mouth that are usually caused by smoking (oral leukoplakia). Early research shows that taking a specific lycopene supplement by mouth twice daily improves white pre-cancerous patches in the mouth.
A painful mouth diseases that reduces ones ability to open the mouth (oral submucous fibrosis). Some people with this condition can't open their mouth as wide as normal. Taking lycopene for 2-6 months might help these people open their mouth slightly wider.
Ovarian cancer. The effect of lycopene on ovarian cancer risk is unclear. Some research shows that young women who get more lycopene in their diet have a lower the risk of ovarian cancer. But other research shows no link between lycopene intake and ovarian cancer risk.
Pancreatic cancer. Some early research shows that a diet high in lycopene, primarily from tomatoes, seems to lower the risk of developing pancreatic cancer.
Skin rash caused by sun exposure (polymorphous light eruption or PMLE). Early research shows that a combination product containing lycopene and other ingredients can reduce skin reactions to light in people with PMLE.
A pregnancy complication marked by high blood pressure and protein in the urine (pre-eclampsia). Research on the effect of lycopene for preventing high blood pressure during pregnancy is unclear. Some research shows that taking a specific lycopene supplement twice daily starting between weeks 16 and 20 of pregnancy and continuing until delivery lowers blood pressure and reduces associated complications. However, other research suggests that lycopene does not affect blood pressure during pregnancy. 
Prostate cancer. Research on the effects of lycopene for preventing or treating prostate cancer is inconsistent. Some research suggests that increasing lycopene consumption in the diet, or having higher lycopene blood levels, is linked with a lower risk of prostate cancer. However, other research shows no link between lycopene intake or blood levels and prostate cancer risk. In addition, early research in men with precancerous changes in their prostate shows that taking lycopene supplements might delay or prevent the progression to prostate cancer. However, in other research, taking lycopene daily for up to one year did not seem to help treat prostate cancer.
Kidney cancer. Early research shows no link between lycopene consumption in the diet and the risk of developing kidney cancer
Sunburn. Early research shows that taking lycopene by mouth, alone or together with other ingredients, might protect against sunburn

It is obtained from the diet and is necessary for the body to make proteins. L-arginine is found in red meat, poultry, fish, and dairy products. It can also be made in a laboratory and used as medicine.

L-arginine is most commonly used for recovery after surgery, a pregnancy complication marked by high blood pressure and protein in the urine (pre-eclampsia), and heart and blood vessel conditions, such as chest pain (angina) and high blood pressure. It is also used for many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these uses.

Taking L-arginine seems to decrease symptoms and improve exercise tolerance and quality of life in people with angina. However, L-arginine does not seem to help widen the blood vessels that are narrowed in angina.
Erectile dysfunction (ED). Taking 5 grams of L-arginine by mouth daily seems to improve sexual function in men with ED. Taking lower doses might not be effective. However, there is some early evidence that taking L-arginine with maritime pine bark extract and other ingredients, might improve the effectiveness of low-dose L-arginine for ED.
High blood pressure. There is evidence that taking L-arginine by mouth can reduce blood pressure in healthy people, people with high blood pressure, and people with slightly high blood pressure with or without diabetes.
A serious intestinal disease in premature infants (necrotizing enterocolitis or NEC). Adding L-arginine to formula seems to prevent inflammation of the digestive tract in premature infants. A total of 6 premature infants need to receive arginine to prevent one instance of digestive tract inflammation.
Narrowing of blood vessels that causes poor blood flow to the limbs (peripheral arterial disease). Research shows that taking L-arginine by mouth or intravenously (by IV) for up to 8 weeks increases blood flow in people with peripheral arterial disease. However, long-term use (up to 6 months) does not improve walking speed or distance in these same people.
A pregnancy complication marked by high blood pressure and protein in the urine (pre-eclampsia). Most research shows that L-arginine can reduce blood pressure in pregnant women with pre-eclampsia. L-arginine also seems to keep pregnant women from developing pre-eclampsia.
High blood pressure during pregnancy. Taking L-arginine intravenously (by IV) can reduce blood pressure in pregnant women who develop high blood pressure. It's unclear if taking L-arginine by mouth lowers blood pressure during pregnancy, but it might decrease the need to take blood pressure lowering drugs.
Possibly ineffective for...Long-term kidney disease (chronic kidney disease or CKD). Most early research suggests that taking L-arginine by mouth or intravenously (by IV) does not improve kidney function in most people with kidney failure or kidney disease. However, taking L-arginine by mouth might improve kidney function and reverse anemia in elderly people with kidney disease-associated anemia.
Heart attack. Taking L-arginine does not seem to help prevent a heart attack. It also does not seem to be beneficial for treating a heart attack after it has occurred. In fact, there is concern that L-arginine might be harmful for people after a recent heart attack. Do not take L-arginine if you have had a recent heart attack.
Tuberculosis. Adding arginine to standard treatment for tuberculosis does not seem to help improve symptoms or clear the infection.
Wound healing. Taking L-arginine does not seem to improve wound healing.Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Altitude sickness. Early research suggests that L-arginine does not reduce altitude sickness.
Small tears in the lining of the anus (anal fissures). There is inconsistent evidence about that effects of L-arginine for treating anal fissures. Applying a topical gel containing L-arginine for at least 12 weeks might heal anal fissures in people who do not respond to traditional care. However, applying L-arginine to the skin does not seem to be better than surgery for anal fissures.
Athletic performance. There is inconsistent evidence about the effects of L-arginine on athletic performance. L-arginine might help people exercise longer, but it does not seem to help make people stronger. Some evidence shows that taking L-arginine increases the time a person can exercise before becoming tired and helps the lungs work more efficiently. However, taking L-arginine does not affect strength during exercise.
Breast cancer. Early research shows that taking L-arginine before chemotherapy does not improve the response rate in people with breast cancer.
Heart failure and fluid build up in the body (congestive heart failure or CHF). Taking L-arginine by mouth, together with conventional treatment, seems to improve kidney function in people with heart failure. But it doesn't seem to improve the ability to exercise. L-arginine should not be used in place of conventional treatment.
Surgery to improve blood flow to the heart (CABG surgery). There is mixed evidence about the effects of L-arginine in protecting the heart during CABG. Some research suggests that giving L-arginine intravenously (by IV) may be helpful in people undergoing CABG. Other research shows that it does not help.
Heart disease. Early research suggests that taking L-arginine intravenously (by IV) before exercising can improve blood vessel function in people with heart disease. However, it does not improve blood flow to the heart.
Cystic fibrosis. Early research shows that breathing in a solution containing L-arginine does not improve lung function any more than breathing in saline. 
Diseases, such as Alzheimer disease, that interfere with thinking (dementia). Early research suggests that L-arginine might improve memory loss related to aging.
Cavities. Early research suggests that using a sugarless mint containing an arginine complex (CaviStat) for one year reduces the number of cavities in molars of children compared with sugarless mints that do not contain arginine. Also, using a toothpaste containing arginine, calcium, and fluoride reduces cavity production by a small amount compared to toothpaste containing only fluoride.
Tooth sensitivity. Early research suggests that using a toothpaste containing arginine, calcium, and fluoride reduces tooth sensitivity when used twice daily.
Diabetes. Taking L-arginine by mouth seems to improve blood sugar control in people with existing diabetes. However, it is unclear if arginine helps prevent people with pre-diabetes from developing diabetes.
Foot sores in people with diabetes. Early research shows that applying L-arginine to the feet daily can improve circulation in people with diabetes, which might be helpful in preventing diabetic foot ulcers. However, if there is already an ulcer on the foot, injecting L-arginine under the skin near the ulcer does not seem to shorten healing time or lower the chance of needing an amputation in the future. Taking L-arginine by mouth with other amino acids doesn't seem to help foot ulcers heal better in most people with diabetes. But it might help people with diabetes who have low levels of protein in the blood or those with poor circulation to the feet.
Nerve pain in people with diabetes (diabetic neuropathy). Early research suggests that taking L-arginine daily for 3 months does not improve nerve damage related to diabetes.
Chest pain with no apparent cause (functional chest pain). Early research suggests that taking L-arginine by mouth or as an infusion can reduces the number and intensity of chest pain attacks in people with chest pain that is not related to the heart.
Head and neck cancer. Supplementing a feeding tube with L-arginine does not seem to improve immune function, reduce tumor size, or improve healing in people with head and neck cancer.
Heart failure. Early research shows that taking L-arginine by mouth or receiving L-arginine by IV does not seem to improve a person's ability to exercise, quality of life, or blood circulation. L-arginine should not be used in place of conventional treatment.
Complications after a heart transplant. Early research suggests that taking L-arginine by mouth for 6 weeks increases walking distance and improves breathing in people with a heart transplant.
Involuntary weight loss in people with HIV/AIDS. Taking L-arginine by mouth, along with hydroxymethylbutyrate (HMB) and glutamine, for 8 weeks, seems to increase body weight and improve immune function in people with HIV/AIDS. However, taking L-arginine by mouth, along with omega-3 fatty acids and a balanced nutritional supplement, for 6 months does not improve body weight or fat mass, energy intake, or immune function in people who are HIV-positive.
High cholesterol. Early research shows that taking L-arginine doesn't help to lower cholesterol levels.
Inability to become pregnant within a year of trying to conceive (infertility). Some early research suggests that taking 16 grams of L-arginine daily increases the number of eggs collected in women undergoing IVF. However, it does not seem to improve pregnancy rates. 
Painful bladder syndrome (interstitial cystitis). Taking L-arginine by mouth seems to reduce pain and some symptoms of bladder inflammation, although improvements may take 3 months to occur.  However, L-arginine does not seem to reduce the need to urinate at night or improve the frequency of urination.
Infants with birth weight below the 10th percentile due to inadequate nutrition. Early research suggests that taking L-arginine during pregnancy can increase the birthweight of babies who show poor growth while still in their mother's womb. However, L-arginine does not seem to increase birthweight or reduce the risk of the baby dying if the baby has extremely poor growth while in the womb.
Kidney transplant. There is conflicting evidence about the effects of L-arginine for people with kidney transplants. It is unclear if it helps.
Conditions in a man that prevent him from getting a woman pregnant within a year of trying to conceive (male infertility). Early research shows that taking L-arginine does not improve sperm function or count in men with unexplained infertility. However, taking L-arginine with maritime pine bark extract might help sperm move faster.
A group of disorders that most often cause muscle weakness (mitochondrial myopathies). There is some interest in using L-arginine to improve symptoms associated with MELAS. Early research suggests that administering L-arginine intravenously (by IV) soon after stroke-like symptoms improves headaches, nausea, vomiting, blindness, and the appearance of bright spots in the eyes. Some research also shows that taking L-arginine every day might reduce the risk of stroke-like symptoms. But not all research agrees.
Migraine. Taking L-arginine by mouth along with the painkiller ibuprofen seems to be effective for treating migraine headache. This combination sometimes starts to work within 30 minutes. However, it is hard to know how much of the pain relief is due to L-arginine, since ibuprofen can relieve migraine pain on its own.
A group of inherited disorders that cause muscle weakness and muscle loss (muscular dystrophy). Very early research suggests that taking L-arginine with a drug called metformin might help with muscle control and walking ability in children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
Reduced benefit of nitrate therapy that happens when nitrates are used all day (nitrate tolerance). Taking L-arginine by mouth seems to prevent tolerance in people who take nitroglycerin for chest pain.
Obesity. Early research shows that taking arginine may decrease waist size and weight in women.
Physical performance in elderly adults. Early research in active elderly women shows that taking L-arginine by mouth doesn't improve leg strength or performance on tests that measure the ability to complete certain daily activities like standing up from a chair.  
A hormonal disorder that causes enlarged ovaries with cysts (polycystic ovary syndrome or PCOS). Early research suggests that taking N-acetyl-cysteine and L-arginine daily for 6 months can improve menstrual function and reduces insulin resistance in people with polycystic ovarian syndrome.
Infection after surgery. Taking L-arginine with other compounds before surgery or after surgery seems to help reduce the number of infections after surgery. But L-arginine probably does not work when taken by itself. 
Re-narrowing of a blood vessel after stent placement or angioplasty (restenosis). Some research suggests that giving L-arginine during stent implantation followed by L-arginine supplementation by mouth for 2 weeks after stent implantation does not reduce the risk of restricted blood flow. However, other evidence suggests that administering L-arginine at the site of stent implantation may reduce artery wall thickening.
Infection of the airways. Early research suggests that taking L-arginine by mouth for 60 days prevents the recurrence of respiratory infections in children.
Schizophrenia. Early research shows that taking L-arginine does not help people with schizophrenia who are already using appropriate treatment.
Sickle-cell disease. Early research shows that taking L-arginine by mouth or as an injection (by IV) for 5 days might be useful for adults with sickle cell disease who have high blood pressure in the lungs. L-arginine might also help to reduce the amount of pain medications needed to control pain in children who are in the hospital because of a  sickle cell attack (sickle cell crisis).
Toxic side effects caused by the drug valproic acid. Giving L-arginine intravenously (by IV) might reduce high levels of ammonia in the blood during treatment with valproic acid in some people.
Swelling (inflammation) and sores inside the mouth (oral mucositis). Early research shows that taking L-arginine by mouth along with other ingredients does not prevent sores in the mouth during cancer treatment.
Bed sores (pressure ulcers).
Critical illness (trauma).
Prevention of the common cold.
Recovery after surgery.
Sexual problems that prevent satisfaction during sexual activity.
Skin damage caused by radiation therapy (radiation dermatitis).

Cataracts. Research shows that injecting a solution that contains chondroitin sulfate and sodium hyaluronate into the eye protects the eye during cataract surgery. Many different products containing chondroitin sulfate and sodium hyaluronate have been reviewed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use during cataract surgery. However, it's not clear if adding chondroitin sulfate to sodium hyaluronate solutions helps reduce pressure within the eye after cataract surgery compared to other similar treatments. Some early studies suggest that a specific eye solution containing chondroitin sulfate and hyaluronate (Viscoat, Alcon Laboratories) can decrease pressure in the eye and improve overall eye health after a cataract is removed. However, the drops do not appear to be better than drops containing hyaluronate alone or another chemical called hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose. The effect of solutions containing only chondroitin sulfate on cataract surgery is not known.
Osteoarthritis. Clinical research shows that taking chondroitin sulfate by mouth modestly improves pain and function in some people with osteoarthritis when used for up to 6 months. It seems to work best in people with more severe pain and when a pharmaceutical-grade preparation is used. Specific products that have shown benefit in patients with osteoarthritis include Chondrosulf (IBSA Institut Biochimique SA), Chondrosan (Bioibérica, S.A.), and Structrum (Laboratoires Pierre Fabre). But pain relief is likely to be small at best. Other research shows that taking chondroitin sulfate for up to 2 years might slow the progression of osteoarthritis.

Some research has evaluated the effects of chondroitin sulfate when taken by mouth in combination with glucosamine. Some research shows that taking specific products containing chondroitin sulfate and glucosamine helps reduce symptoms of osteoarthritis. Other research shows no benefit when non-commercial preparations are used. Taking chondroitin sulfate plus glucosamine long-term appears to slow the progression of osteoarthritis. 

There is some evidence that a skin cream containing chondroitin sulfate in combination with glucosamine sulfate, shark cartilage, and camphor can reduce osteoarthritis symptoms. However, any symptom relief is most likely due to the camphor and not the other ingredients. There is no research showing that chondroitin is absorbed through the skin.


Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Joint pain caused by drugs called aromatase inhibitors (aromatase inhibitor-induced arthralgias). Early research suggests that taking a combination of glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate in two or three divided doses daily for 24 weeks improves joint pain and symptoms caused by drugs used to treat breast cancer.
Dry eye. Early research shows that using chondroitin sulfate eye drops can decrease dry eyes. Other research shows that using eye drops containing chondroitin sulfate and xanthan gum can improve dry eyes about as well as using artificial tears. But other early research shows no benefit.
Muscle soreness caused by exercise. Early research shows that taking chondroitin sulfate daily does not reduce muscle soreness after exercise in men.
Swelling (inflammation) of the stomach (gastritis). Early research shows that drinking a specific liquid containing chondroitin sulfate and hyaluronic acid can decrease abdominal pain in people with gastritis.
Painful bladder syndrome (interstitial cystitis). Some research shows that putting liquid with chondroitin sulfate into the bladder can improve painful bladder symptoms. But most of these studies are low quality. Some higher-quality studies suggest that using chondroitin sulfate inside the bladder is not beneficial. Some early research shows that taking a product containing chondroitin sulfate and other ingredients by mouth can improve painful bladder. But it's not clear if the benefit is from chondroitin sulfate or the other ingredients.
A disorder that affects the bones and joints, usually in people with selenium deficiency (Kashin-Beck disease). Early research suggests that chondroitin sulfate, with or without glucosamine hydrochloride, can reduce pain in people with Kashin-Beck disease. Also, taking chondroitin sulfate with glucosamine sulfate can slow joint space narrowing in people with this bone disease. However, it is unclear if taking chondroitin sulfate alone slows joint space narrowing.
Heart attack. Some early research shows that taking chondroitin sulfate by mouth might lower the risk of having a first or recurrent heart attack.
Scaly, itchy skin (psoriasis). Early research suggests that taking chondroitin sulfate for 2-3 months decreases pain and improves skin conditions in people with psoriasis. But other research suggests that taking chondroitin sulfate (Condrosan, CS Bio-Active, Bioiberica S.A., Barcelona, Spain) daily for 3 months does not reduce psoriasis severity in people with psoriasis and knee osteoarthritis.
Loss of bladder control (urinary incontinence). Early research suggests that inserting sodium chondroitin sulfate into the bladder through a urinary catheter improves quality of life in people with overactive bladder.

Seizures. Administering vitamin B6 intravenously (by IV) controls seizures in infants that are caused by vitamin B6 dependence.
A condition in which the body makes abnormal red blood cells that build up iron (sideroblastic anemia). Taking vitamin B6 by mouth is effective for treating an inherited type of anemia called sideroblastic anemia.
Vitamin B6 deficiency. Taking vitamin B6 by mouth is effective for preventing and treating vitamin B6 deficiency.
Likely effective for...High levels of homocysteine in the blood (hyperhomocysteinemia). Taking vitamin B6 by mouth, usually with folic acid, is effective for treating high homocysteine levels in the blood.
Possibly effective for...An eye disease that leads to vision loss in older adults (age-related macular degeneration). Some research shows that taking vitamin B6 with other vitamins including folic acid and vitamin B12 might help prevent the loss of vision caused by an eye disease called macular degeneration.
Hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis). As people age, their arteries tend to lose their ability to stretch and flex. Garlic and other ingredients seem to reduce this effect. Taking a specific supplement containing garlic, amino acids (part of proteins), and vitamins such as folic acid, vitamin B12, and vitamin B6 (Kyolic, Total Heart Health, Formula 108, Wakunga) seem to reduce symptoms of hardening of the arteries.
Kidney stones. People with a hereditary disorder called type I primary hyperoxaluria have an increased risk of forming kidney stones. There is some evidence that taking vitamin B6 by mouth, alone or along with magnesium, or getting vitamin B6 injected into the vein, can decrease the risk of kidney stones in people with this condition. However, it does not appear to help people with other kinds of kidney stones.
Morning sickness. Some research suggests that taking vitamin B6, usually as pyridoxine, improves symptoms of mild to moderate nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology considers vitamin B6 a first-line treatment for nausea and vomiting caused by pregnancy. Vitamin B6 plus the medication doxylamine is recommended for women who do not get better when treated with just vitamin B6. However, taking this combination is less effective than the medication ondansetron.
Premenstrual syndrome (PMS). There is some evidence that taking vitamin B6 as pyridoxine by mouth can improve PMS symptoms including breast pain. The lowest effective dose should be used. Higher doses will increase the chance of side effects and are not likely to increase the beneficial effects.
A movement disorder often caused by antipsychotic drugs (tardive dyskinesia). Taking vitamin B6 seems to improve movement disorders in people taking certain drugs for schizophrenia.
Possibly ineffective for...
Decline in memory and thinking skills that occurs normally with age. . One study shows that taking vitamin B6, folic acid, and vitamin B12 might help prevent certain parts of the brain from deteriorating in elderly people. However, most research shows that taking vitamin B6 along with folic acid and vitamin B12 does not improve mental function in elderly people.
Alzheimer disease. Early research suggests that higher intake of vitamin B6 from supplements or as part of the diet is not associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer disease in older people.
Autism. Taking vitamin B6 along with magnesium does not seem to improve behavior in children with autism.
Carpal tunnel syndrome. Although some early research suggests that taking vitamin B6 might relieve certain symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome, most research suggests that this supplement does not benefit people with this condition.
Cataracts. Research shows that taking vitamin B6 in combination with folic acid and vitamin B12 does not prevent cataracts in women. And it might increase the risk of having the cataracts removed.
An adverse skin reaction caused by cancer drug treatment (chemotherapy-induced acral erythema). Hand-foot syndrome is a skin reaction caused by cancer drugs. Taking vitamin B6 doesn't seem to prevent this skin reaction in people treated with cancer drugs. There's also concern that vitamin B6 might reduce how well the cancer drugs work.
Non-cancerous growths in the large intestine and rectum (colorectal adenoma). Research shows that taking a combination of folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 does not reduce the risk of colorectal polyps in women at high risk of heart disease.
Weak and brittle bones (osteoporosis). Research shows that taking a combination of folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 does not prevent broken bones in people with weak bones (osteoporosis).
Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Acne. Early research suggests that taking a product containing nicotinamide, azelaic acid, zinc, vitamin B6, copper, and folic acid, reduces lesion swelling and helps with the appearance of acne in adults and children.
A procedure to open a blocked or narrowed blood vessel (angioplasty). Evidence on the benefits of vitamin B6 for preventing the re-blockage of blood vessels after angioplasty is inconsistent. Some evidence suggests that taking folic acid, vitamin B12, and vitamin B6 might reduce the re-blockage of blood vessels in people treated with balloon angioplasty. But other research shows no benefit in people who underwent coronary stenting.
Asthma. The effectiveness of vitamin B6 supplementation in children with asthma is unclear.
Eczema (atopic dermatitis). Early research shows that taking vitamin B6 daily for 4 weeks does not reduce eczema symptoms in children.
Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Early research shows that taking vitamin B6 by mouth, with or without high doses of other B vitamins, might help ADHD. However, research using high doses of both vitamin B6 and other vitamins seems to have no effect on ADHD symptoms. 
Cancer. Eating more foods that contain vitamin B6 has been linked with a lower risk of cancer. But taking vitamin B6 along with other vitamins and nutrients doesn't prevent cancer in people with heart disease or kidney damage.
Heart disease. Taking B vitamin combinations that include vitamin B6 does not seem to prevent death or heart attack in people with heart disease. But some recent data shows it might slightly lower the risk of stroke.
Cavities. Taking vitamin B6 may reduce the risk of dental cavities during pregnancy.
Depression. Eating more food that contains vitamin B6 has been linked with a lower risk of depression. Taking a vitamin B6 supplement doesn't seem to reduce depression symptoms in most people. But it might reduce the risk of developing depression in women taking birth control pills.
Diabetes. Early research suggests that taking vitamin B6 improves blood sugar levels in women who are pregnant and have low levels of vitamin B6. But not all research agrees.
Nerve pain in people with diabetes (diabetic neuropathy). There is conflicting evidence about the role of vitamin B6 in people with diabetes-related nerve pain . Some research suggests that taking vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) with thiamine or folic acid and vitamin B12 improves some symptoms of nerve pain so that people feel happier. However, the nerves do not seem to function any better.
Menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhea). Early research suggests that taking vitamin B6 daily might reduce painful periods.
Seizures in women with pre-eclampsia (eclampsia). Taking vitamin B doesn't seem to reduce the risk of seizures during pregnancy.
High blood pressure. Early research suggests that taking pyridoxine can lower blood pressure in people with high blood pressure.
High levels of fats called triglycerides in the blood (hypertriglyceridemia). Early research suggests that taking vitamin B6 does not reduce high levels of blood fats called triglycerides. However, it might slightly reduce cholesterol levels.
Insomnia. Some research shows that taking a product containing a protein called casein, plants called zizyphus and hops, as well as magnesium and vitamin B6, does not help people sleep better.
Nerve damage caused by a drug for tuberculosis (isoniazid-induced neuropathy). Early research suggests that taking vitamin B6 daily might reduce nerve damage caused by isoniazid, a medication taken for tuberculosis.
Breast-feeding. Early research suggests that taking vitamin B6 daily for about one week after giving birth does not stop breast milk production.
Lung cancer. People who have higher blood levels of vitamin B6 seem to have a lower risk of lung cancer. This seems to be especially true for men and for people with a history of smoking. It's unclear if taking vitamin B6 as a supplement can reduce the risk of lung cancer.
Nausea and vomiting. Early research suggests that taking vitamin B6 does not reduce nausea or vomiting or improve symptoms of dehydration in children with an infection in the stomach or intestines. However it might reduce the risk of nausea in women taking birth control pills.
A pregnancy complication marked by high blood pressure and protein in the urine (pre-eclampsia). Taking vitamin B6 doesn't seem to reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia.
Preterm birth. Taking vitamin B6 doesn't seem to reduce the risk of preterm birth.
Seizures not caused by epilepsy. Early research suggests that taking vitamin B6 daily for 12 months does not reduce the risk of seizures caused by a high fever in children.
Stroke. Taking B vitamin supplements that include vitamin B6 might slightly reduce stroke risk in people with heart disease. But it's unknown which combination of B vitamins has the most benefit.

Heart disease. There is some early evidence that drinking grape juice or red wine might reduce risk factors linked with heart disease, such as inflammation, clot formation, and oxidative damage to blood fats. But it's not known if grape products specifically reduce heart disease risk.
Memory and thinking skills (cognitive function). Early research shows that drinking Concord grape juice helps middle-aged women focus while driving. Also taking a grape fruit extract for 12 weeks seems to improve attention, language, and memory in older people without age-related memory problems. It's unclear if grape improves mental function or memory in older people with age-related memory problems. 
Decline in memory and thinking skills in older people that is more than what is normal for their age. Most early research suggests that grape does not improve mental function or memory in older people with memory problems. 
Colon cancer, rectal cancer. Taking a product containing grape seed extract and other ingredients while being treated with cancer drugs seems to help prevent colon and rectal cancer from progressing. But it doesn't seem to improve survival.
Vision problems in people with diabetes (diabetic retinopathy). Early research shows that taking specific grape seed extract products might slow the progression of eye damage caused by diabetes. 
High cholesterol. Taking grape seed extract or grape extract might reduce some measures of cholesterol and blood fats called triglycerides by a small amount in people with high cholesterol. It doesn't seem to improve high-density lipoprotein (HDL or ""good"") cholesterol. But some studies disagree, and it is not clear which product or dose might work best. 
High blood pressure. Most research has evaluated grape seed extract or isolated chemicals from grape called polyphenols in people with high blood pressure. Single studies show conflicting results. But analyses of multiple studies suggest that grape seed extract or grape polyphenols can slightly lower blood pressure in healthy people or those with high blood pressure. They seem to work best in people who are obese or those with metabolic syndrome. It might take 8 weeks for benefits to be seen. 
Dark skin patches on the face (melasma). Early research suggests that taking grape seed extract by mouth for 6-11 months reduces dark skin discolorations in Japanese women.
Symptoms of menopause. Taking grape seed extract daily for 8 weeks seems to reduce hot flashes, anxiety, and some physical symptoms of menopause. It may also improve lean body mass and diastolic blood pressure (the bottom number in a blood pressure reading). But grape seed extract doesn't seem to improve insomnia or depression.
A grouping of symptoms that increase the risk of diabetes, heart disease, and stroke (metabolic syndrome). Some research shows that taking grape products can help to lower blood pressure and levels of blood fats like cholesterol in adults with metabolic syndrome. But it is not known if these changes decrease the risk for diabetes or other aspects of metabolic syndrome.
Minor bleeding. An episiotomy is a surgical cut used to enlarge the opening of the vagina to aid in childbirth. Early research shows that using a product called Ankaferd blood stopper, which contains alpinia, licorice, thyme, stinging nettle, and grape vine helps to reduce bleeding during episiotomy repair. But it doesn't reduce surgical time.
Muscle soreness. Early research shows that drinking juice prepared from grape powder for 6 weeks before an arm exercise test does not reduce pain or swelling one or two days after the exercise.
Ability to see in low-light conditions. Early research suggests that grape seed extract containing chemicals called proanthocyanidins might improve night vision.
Build up of fat in the liver in people who drink little or no alcohol (nonalcoholic fatty liver disease or NAFLD). Research shows that taking grape seed extract for 3 months improves some blood tests of liver damage in people with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.
Premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Early research suggests that taking a specific grape seed extract product might reduce PMS symptoms, including pain and swelling.

Pantothenic acid is frequently used in combination with other B vitamins in vitamin B complex formulations. Vitamin B complex generally includes vitamin B1 (thiamine), vitamin B2 (riboflavin), vitamin B3 (niacin/niacinamide), vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid), vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin), and folic acid. However, some products do not contain all of these ingredients and some may include others, such as biotin, para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), choline bitartrate, and inositol.

Pantothenic acid has a long list of uses, although there isn't enough scientific evidence to determine whether it is effective for most of these uses. People take pantothenic acid for treating dietary deficiencies, acne, alcoholism, allergies, baldness, asthma, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, burning feet syndrome, yeast infections, heart failure, carpal tunnel syndrome, breathing problems, celiac disease, colitis, pink eye (conjunctivitis), seizures, and bladder infections. It is also taken by mouth for dandruff, depression, diabetic nerve pain, enhancing immune function, improving athletic performance, tongue infections, gray hair, headache, hyperactivity, low blood sugar, trouble sleeping (insomnia), irritability, low blood pressure, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, leg cramps associated with pregnancy or alcoholism, general nerve pain, and obesity.


Pantothenic acid is also taken by mouth for osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, Parkinson's disease, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), enlarged prostate, protection against mental and physical stress and anxiety, reducing side effects of thyroid therapy for people with decreased function of the thyroid gland, reducing signs of aging, reducing the risk of getting a cold or other infection, delayed growth, shingles, skin disorders, stimulating adrenal glands, sore mouth (stomatitis), chronic fatigue syndrome, toxicity related to medications such as salicylates or streptomycin, dizziness, constipation, and wound healing. It is also used following surgery to improve movement in the intestines and to reduce sore throat.


People apply dexpanthenol, which is made from pantothenic acid, to the skin for itching, promoting healing of mild eczemas and other skin conditions, insect stings, bites, poison ivy, diaper rash, and acne. It is also applied topically for preventing and treating skin reactions to radiation therapy. It is also applie to reduce skin reactions to radiotherapy treatment, for dry eyes and eye trauma, and for sprains.

Dexpanthenol is given with a needle in to the vein or muscle to improve intestinal movement (intestinal peristalsis), possibly following surgery of the gut, for abdominal bloating (distension) due to reduced intestinal function, and for gas following surgery or pregnancy.

A nasal spray containing dexpanthenol is used to reduce the feeling of having a stuffed nose (nasal obstruction) and to reduce a runny nose (nasal discharge).

People take Bacillus coagulans for diarrhea, including infectious types such as rotaviral diarrhea, traveler's diarrhea, and diarrhea caused by antibiotics. Bacillus coagulans is also used for general digestion problems, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), gas (flatulence), a bowel disorder called Clostridium difficile colitis, and excessive growth of ""bad"" bacteria in the intestine. It is also used in people with liver cirrhosis, for an infection due to the ulcer-causing bacterium Helicobacter pylori, for rheumatoid arthritis, and for HIV/AIDS. 

Some people use Bacillus coagulans to prevent respiratory infections and ramp up the immune system. It is also used to prevent cancer or the formation of cancer-causing agents. There is also some interest in using it as an additive to vaccines to improve their effectiveness.

Bacillus coagulans produces lactic acid and is often misclassified as lactobacillus. In fact, some commercial products containing Bacillus coagulans are marketed as Lactobacillus sporogenes. Unlike lactic acid bacteria such as lactobacillus or bifidobacteria, Bacillus coagulans forms spores. Spores are an important factor in telling Bacillus coagulans apart from other lactic acid bacteria.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Clinical research shows that taking Bacillus coagulans daily for 56-90 days improves quality of life and decreases bloating, vomiting, abdominal pain, and the number of bowel movements in people with diarrhea-predominant IBS. Other clinical research shows that taking a specific combination product (Colinox, DMG Italia SRL) containing Bacillus coagulans and simethicone three times daily for 4 weeks improves bloating and discomfort in people with IBS.

Liver scarring (cirrhosis). People with liver cirrhosis are more likely to develop an infection called spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, or SBP. Early research shows that taking a combination probiotic containing Bacillus coagulans and other bacteria three times daily, along with the drug norfloxacin, does not decrease a person's risk of developing SBP. 
Diarrhea. Early research in babies 6-24 months of age with diarrhea shows that taking Bacillus coagulans twice daily for up to 5 days does not decrease the duration, frequency, or quantity of diarrhea.
Diarrhea in children caused by a certain virus (rotavirus). Early research in newborn babies shows that taking Bacillus coagulans daily for one year decreases the child's risk of developing rotavirus diarrhea.
Gas (flatulence). Early evidence in people who have gas after eating shows that taking a specific combination supplement containing Bacillus coagulans and a blend of enzymes daily for 4 weeks does not improve bloating or gas. 
Growth of bacteria in the intestine. Early evidence shows that using a specific probiotic product (Lactol, Bioplus Life Sciences Pvt.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Early research shows that taking Bacillus coagulans daily for 60 days in addition to normal treatment can reduce pain, but does not reduce the number of painful or swollen joints in people with RA. Bacillus coagulans also does not improve the ability to perform activities of daily living in people with RA.
Serious infection of the intestines (necrotizing enterocolitis). Babies that are born very early or with a very low weight are at a higher risk of developing a serious infection in the intestines called necrotizing enterocolitis. Early research in these babies shows that taking Bacillus coagulans daily until leaving the hospital does not prevent necrotizing enterocolitis or death. However, taking Bacillus coagulans does increase the number of babies that are able to tolerate food.

MPlusHerbsSupplements,https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/982.html,"Zinc is a mineral. It is called an ""essential trace element"" because very small amounts of zinc are necessary for human health. Since the human body does not store excess zinc, it must be consumed regularly as part of the diet. Common dietary sources of zinc include red meat, poultry, and fish. Zinc deficiency can cause short stature, reduced ability to taste food, and the inability of testes and ovaries to function properly.


Zinc is used for the treatment and prevention of zinc deficiency and its consequences, including stunted growth and acute diarrhea in children, slow wound healing, and Wilson's disease. Zinc is also used for many other conditions. There is some scientific evidence to support its use for some of these conditions. But for most, there is no good scientific evidence to support its use. 


Note that many zinc products also contain another metal called cadmium. This is because zinc and cadmium are chemically similar and often occur together in nature. Exposure to high levels of cadmium over a long time can lead to kidney failure. The concentration of cadmium in zinc-containing supplements can vary as much as 37-fold. Look for zinc-gluconate products. Zinc gluconate consistently contains the lowest cadmium levels.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): While zinc may have benefit for the common cold and other airway infections, there is no good evidence to support using it for COVID-19. Follow healthy lifestyle choices and proven prevention methods instead.
",information,Zinc,What is Zinc ?,Drugs
MPlusHerbsSupplements,https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/982.html,"Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale:  Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate.The effectiveness ratings for ZINC are as follows:Effective for...Zinc deficiency. Zinc deficiency might occur in people with severe diarrhea, conditions that make it hard for the bowel to absorb food, liver cirrhosis, and alcoholism. It may also occur after major surgery and during long-term use of tube feeding in the hospital. Taking zinc by mouth or giving zinc intravenously (by IV) helps to restore zinc levels in people who are zinc deficient. However, taking zinc supplements regularly is not recommended.
Likely effective for...Diarrhea. Taking zinc by mouth reduces the duration and severity of diarrhea in children who are undernourished or zinc deficient. Severe zinc deficiency in children is common in developing countries. Also giving zinc to undernourished women during pregnancy and for one month after delivery reduces the incidence of diarrhea in infants during the first year of life.
An inherited disorder that causes copper to build up in many organs (Wilson disease). Taking zinc by mouth improves symptoms of an inherited disorder called Wilson disease. People with Wilson disease have too much copper in their bodies. Zinc blocks how much copper is absorbed and increases how much copper the body releases.
Possibly effective for...Acne. Research suggests that people with acne have lower blood and skin levels of zinc. Taking zinc by mouth appears to help treat acne. However, it's unclear how beneficial zinc is compared to acne medications such as tetracycline or minocycline. Applying zinc to the skin in an ointment does not seem to help treat acne unless used in combination with the antibiotic drug called erythromycin.
A disorder of zinc deficiency (acrodermatitis enteropathica). Taking zinc by mouth seems to help improve symptoms of acrodermatitis enteropathica. 
An eye disease that leads to vision loss in older adults (age-related macular degeneration or AMD). People who consume more zinc as part of their diet seem to have a lower risk of developing age-related vision loss. Research shows that taking supplements containing zinc and antioxidant vitamins may modestly slow vision loss and prevent age-related vision loss from becoming advanced in people at high risk. It's still not clear if taking zinc along with antioxidant vitamins helps prevent age-related vision loss from becoming advanced in people at low risk. Most research shows that taking zinc alone, without antioxidant vitamins, does not help most people with age-related vision loss. However, it's possible that people with certain genes that make them susceptible to age-related vision loss might benefit from zinc supplements.
An eating disorder (anorexia nervosa). Taking zinc supplements by mouth might help increase weight gain and improve depression symptoms in teens and adults with anorexia.
Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). There is evidence that children with ADHD might have lower blood levels of zinc than children without ADHD. There is also evidence that people with ADHD who have lower zinc levels might not respond well enough to prescription medications for ADHD (stimulants). Thus, zinc supplements are of interest for people with ADHD. Taking zinc by mouth along with medicine for ADHD might slightly improve hyperactivity, impulsiveness, and socialization problems in some children with ADHD. But zinc doesn't seem to improve attention span. Most studies using zinc for ADHD have taken place in the Middle East, where zinc deficiency is more common than in Western countries. One small study shows that taking zinc alone or as add-on therapy to prescription ADHD medication does not consistently improve symptoms of ADHD. But it does seem to lower the optimal dose of ADHD medication that is needed.
Burns. Giving zinc intravenously (by IV) together with other minerals seems to improve wound healing in people with burns. However, taking zinc alone does not appear to improve wound healing in all people with burns, but it might reduce recovery time in people with severe burns.
Non-cancerous growths in the large intestine and rectum (colorectal adenoma). Research suggests that taking a supplement containing selenium, zinc, vitamin A 2, vitamin C, and vitamin E by mouth daily for 5 years reduces the risk of recurrent large-bowel tumors by about 40%.
Common cold. Although some conflicting results exist, most research shows that taking lozenges containing zinc gluconate or zinc acetate by mouth helps reduce the duration of a cold in adults. However, side effects such as bad taste and nausea might limit its usefulness. It is unclear if zinc helps prevent common colds. In adults, taking zinc supplements by mouth does not seem to prevent common colds. However, zinc gluconate lozenges might help prevent colds in children and adolescents. Using zinc as a nose spray does not seem to help prevent colds.
Depression. Early research suggests that zinc levels are lower in people with depression. Ingesting more zinc is associated with less risk of depression. Some research suggests that taking zinc along with antidepressants improves depression in people with major depression. However, other research shows that it improves depression in only people who do not respond to treatment with antidepressants alone. It doesn't seem to improve depression in people who respond to antidepressant treatment.
Diabetes. Taking zinc seems to reduce blood sugar, increase insulin levels, improve the way the body uses insulin, and decrease cholesterol and other fats (lipids) in the blood in people with type 2 diabetes. Zinc also seems to decrease body weight in people with diabetes who are overweight or obese. Taking zinc might also help to lower blood sugar in women who develop diabetes during pregnancy. But it doesn't seem to reduce the need for a caesarean section during labor in these women.
Foot sores in people with diabetes. Research suggests that applying zinc hyaluronate gel can help foot ulcers heal faster than conventional treatment in people with diabetes.
Diaper rash. Giving zinc gluconate by mouth to infants seems to speed up the healing of diaper rash. Applying zinc oxide paste also seems to improve the healing of diaper rash. However, it doesn't seem to work as well as applying 2% eosin solution.
A mild form of gum disease (gingivitis). Using toothpastes containing zinc, with or without an antibacterial agent, appears to prevent plaque and gingivitis. Some evidence also shows that zinc-containing toothpaste can reduce existing plaque. However, other conventional treatments may be more effective. Also, most studies that showed benefit used zinc citrate in combination with triclosan, which is not available in the US.
Bad breath. Research suggests that chewing gum, sucking on a candy, or using a mouth rinse containing zinc reduces bad breath.
Cold sores (herpes labialis). Applying zinc sulfate or zinc oxide to the skin, alone or with other ingredients, seems to reduce the duration and severity of oral and genital herpes. However, zinc might not be beneficial for recurrent herpes infections.
Reduced ability to taste (hypogeusia). Some early research suggests that taking zinc by mouth does not improve taste disorders in children with zinc deficiency. But most evidence suggests that taking zinc by mouth is effective for people with a reduced ability to taste foods due to zinc deficiency or some other conditions.
Skin infection caused by Leishmania parasites (Leishmania lesions). Research suggests that taking zinc sulfate by mouth or injecting as a solution into lesions helps heal lesions in people with Leishmaniasis. However, injecting zinc solutions into lesions does not seem to be more effective than conventional treatments.
Leprosy. Taking zinc by mouth in combination with anti-leprosy drugs seems to help treat leprosy. 
Muscle cramps. Taking zinc by mouth seems to help treat muscle cramps in people with cirrhosis and zinc deficiency.
Weak and brittle bones (osteoporosis). Low zinc intake seems to be linked to lower bone mass. Taking a zinc supplement in combination with copper, manganese, and calcium might decrease bone loss in women who have passed menopause.
Stomach ulcers. Taking zinc acexamate by mouth seems to help treat and prevent peptic ulcers. However, this form of zinc is not available in the US.
Sore throat (pharyngitis). Using a zinc lozenge before surgery that involves having a tube placed into the windpipe seems to reduce the chance of having a sore throat after surgery.
Pneumonia. Most research suggests that taking zinc might help PREVENT pneumonia in undernourished children. However, research assessing the effects of zinc for TREATING pneumonia once it develops shows conflicting.
Preterm birth. Taking zinc by mouth during pregnancy appears to reduce the risk for early delivery. But zinc supplementation doesn't seem to reduce the risk for stillbirths, miscarriage, or infant deaths.
Bed sores (pressure ulcers). Applying zinc paste appears to help improve the healing of bed sores in elderly people. Also, increasing zinc intake in the diet seems to improve bed sore healing in hospitalized patients with bed sore.
Illness from a Shigella bacteria infection (shigellosis). Research shows that taking a multivitamin syrup containing zinc along with conventional treatment can improve recovery time and reduce diarrhea in undernourished children with food poisoning.
Sickle cell disease. Taking zinc by mouth seems to help reduce symptoms of sickle cell disease in people with zinc deficiency. Taking zinc supplements also appears to decrease the risk for complications and infections related to sickle cell disease.
Leg sores caused by weak blood circulation (venous leg ulcer). Taking zinc sulfate by mouth appears to help some types of leg ulcers heal faster. The effects seem to be greater in people with low levels of zinc before treatment. Applying zinc paste to leg ulcers also appears to improve healing.
Vitamin A deficiency. Taking zinc by mouth together with vitamin A seems to improve vitamin A levels in undernourished children better than vitamin A or zinc alone.
Warts. Early research suggests that applying a zinc sulfate solution improves plane warts but not common warts. Applying zinc oxide ointment appears to be as effective as conventional treatments for curing warts. Taking zinc sulfate by mouth also appears to be effective.

Possibly ineffective for...
Patchy hair loss (alopecia areata). Although there is early evidence that suggests taking zinc together with biotin might be helpful for hair loss, most studies suggest that zinc is not effective for this condition.
Eczema (atopic dermatitis). Taking zinc by mouth does not appear to improve skin redness or itching in children with eczema.
Cataracts. Taking zinc by mouth together with antioxidant vitamins does not seem to help treat or prevent cataracts.
Cystic fibrosis. Zinc sulfate does not appear to improve lung function in children or adolescents with cystic fibrosis, although it may reduce the need for antibiotics.
HIV/AIDS. Taking zinc by mouth along with antiretroviral therapy does not improve immune function or reduce the risk of death in adults or children with HIV.
Pregnancy complications in women with HIV/AIDS. Taking zinc by mouth during pregnancy does not appear to reduce the risk of transmitting HIV to the infant. Also, zinc does not appear to prevent infant death or maternal wasting in pregnant women with HIV.
Involuntary weight loss in people with HIV/AIDS. Taking zinc by mouth together with vitamins does not seem to improve AIDS diarrhea-wasting syndrome.
Infant development. Giving zinc to infants or children at risk for having low levels of zinc does not seem to improve mental or motor development. But giving zinc to women during pregnancy might increase the growth of the child during the first year of life.
Long-term swelling (inflammation) in the digestive tract (inflammatory bowel disease or IBD). Taking zinc by mouth does not seem to help treat IBD.
Flu (influenza). Taking zinc supplements by mouth is unlikely to improve immune function against the flu virus in people who are not at risk for zinc deficiency.
Ear infection (otitis media). Taking zinc does not appear to prevent ear infections in children.
A pregnancy complication marked by high blood pressure and protein in the urine (pre-eclampsia). Taking zinc does not seem to reduce the risk of high blood pressure in pregnancy.
Low iron levels in women who are pregnant. Taking zinc by mouth does not seem to help improve iron levels in women taking iron and folic acid supplements.
Prostate cancer. Taking zinc does not seem to be linked to the risk of getting prostate cancer.
Scaly, itchy skin (psoriasis). Taking zinc by mouth does not seem to help treat psoriasis.
Joint swelling (inflammation) in people with psoriasis. Taking zinc by mouth, alone or together with painkillers, has no effect on the progression of psoriatic arthritis.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Taking zinc by mouth does not seem to help treat rheumatoid arthritis.
A skin condition that causes redness on the face (rosacea). Research suggests that taking zinc by mouth daily for 90 days does not improve quality of life or symptoms associated with rosacea.
Sexual problems that prevent satisfaction during sexual activity. Research suggests that zinc supplementation does not improve sexual function in men with sexual dysfunction related to kidney disease.
Ringing in the ears (tinnitus). Taking zinc by mouth does not seem to help treating ringing in the ears.
Upper airway infection. Taking zinc by mouth does not decrease the risk for upper respiratory tract infections.

Likely ineffective for...Malaria. Taking zinc by mouth does not help prevent or treat malaria in undernourished children in developing countries. But some research suggests it might reduce the risk for high fevers in children with malaria. 
Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Liver disease in people who drink alcohol. Taking zinc sulfate by mouth might improve liver function in people with alcohol-related liver disease.
Alzheimer disease. Some early research shows that zinc supplements might slow the worsening of symptoms in people with Alzheimer disease.
Arsenic poisoning. Early research suggests that taking zinc together with spirulina can reduce symptoms and arsenic levels in the urine and hair of people with long-term arsenic poisoning.
Asthma. Zinc intake does not appear to be linked to the risk for developing asthma in children.
A blood disorder that reduces levels of protein in the blood called hemoglobin (beta-thalassemia). Early research suggests that taking zinc sulfate while undergoing blood transfusions increases growth in children with beta-thalassemia compared to blood transfusions alone.
Brain tumor. Early research suggests that zinc intake is not linked with a reduced risk of developing brain cancer.
Swelling (inflammation) of small airways in the lung (bronchiolitis). Taking zinc while in the hospital might speed up recovery from this type of airway infection.
Canker sores. Some early research suggests that taking zinc sulfate improves canker sores and prevents them from reappearing. However, other research shows no benefit.
Tiredness in people treated with cancer drugs. Early research shows that taking zinc does not reduce tiredness or improve life quality in people with colorectal cancer receiving chemotherapy.
A lung disease that makes it harder to breathe (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD). Early research suggests that taking zinc daily after recovery from COPD-related infections reduces the risk of additional infections in older people.
Colon cancer, rectal cancer. Increased intake of zinc has been linked to a 17% to 20% reduced risk of colorectal cancer.
Heart disease. Early research suggests that taking zinc reduces cholesterol but not triglycerides in people with clogged arteries.
Diseases, such as Alzheimer disease, that interfere with thinking (dementia). Research suggests that taking zinc sulfate improves behavior and social abilities in people with memory loss.
Tooth plaque. Early evidence suggests that brushing teeth with toothpaste containing zinc reduces plaque buildup.
Nerve pain in people with diabetes (diabetic neuropathy). Research suggests that taking zinc sulfate improves nerve function and reduces blood sugar in people with nerve damage caused by diabetes.
Down syndrome. Early research suggests that taking zinc can improve immune function and reduce infections in people with Down syndrome who are zinc deficient and have weakened immune systems. However, other research shows conflicting results.
Seizure disorder (epilepsy). Taking zinc might reduce how often seizures occur in children not responding well to other treatments.
Cancer of the esophagus. Early research has linked low intake of zinc with an increased risk of esophageal cancer. However, other early research shows that zinc intake is not linked with the risk of esophageal cancer. It's possible that the source of zinc (plant vs. meat) affects how beneficial it is.
Loss of bowel movement control (fecal incontinence). Research suggests that applying an ointment containing zinc and aluminum to the anus three times daily for 4 weeks improves symptoms and quality of life in women with a loss of control of bowel movements.
Stomach cancer. Early research shows that increased zinc intake is not linked to a lower risk of stomach cancer.
Head and neck cancer. Early research suggests that zinc supplementation does not improve survival rates or reduce the spread of cancer after 3 years in people with head and neck cancer.
Reduced brain function in people with advanced liver disease (hepatic encephalopathy). Early research suggests that taking zinc may slightly improve mental function in people with hepatic encephalopathy. However, zinc does not appear to improve disease severity or recurrence.
Diarrhea in people with HIV/AIDS. Taking zinc long-term might help prevent diarrhea in adults with HIV who have low blood levels of zinc. However, zinc doesn't seem to help treat diarrhea in adults with HIV-related diarrhea. In children with HIV, some research shows that taking zinc reduces the occurrence of diarrhea compared to placebo (sugar pills). But other research shows that it doesn't help prevent diarrhea compared to vitamin A.
Certain infections (opportunistic infections) in people with HIV/AIDS. There is some early evidence that taking zinc supplements by mouth in combination with the drug zidovudine might reduce infections that occur because of a weakened immune system. However, it might negatively affect survival in people with AIDS.
Infection of the intestines by parasites. Taking zinc alone or along with vitamin A might help treat some, but not all, parasite infections in children in developing countries. Also, some research suggests that taking zinc with vitamin A reduces the risk for some infections. However, other research suggests that zinc does not reduce the risk for infection.
Cancer of the white blood cells (leukemia). Research suggests that taking zinc by mouth helps improve weight gain and reduces infection rate in children and adolescents with leukemia. However, zinc does not appear to improve nutrient levels in the body so that the body can function properly.
Infants born weighing less than 2500 grams (5 pounds, 8 ounces). Taking zinc during pregnancy does not seem to reduce the risk of having a newborn with low birth weight. Giving zinc to underweight infants in developing countries seems to decrease the risk of death, prevent certain complications, and improve mental ability. Giving zinc supplementation to low birth weight infants industrialized countries also seems to help prevent some complications and death. But zinc doesn't appear to improve growth in low birth weight infants from industrialized countries.
Conditions in a man that prevent him from getting a woman pregnant within a year of trying to conceive (male infertility). Some early research suggests that zinc supplementation increases sperm count, testosterone levels, and pregnancy rates in infertile men with low testosterone levels. Other research suggests that taking zinc can improve sperm shape in men with moderate enlargement of a vein in the scrotum (grade III varicocele). However, in men with fertility problems due to diseases or medical treatment, taking zinc has produced mixed results.
Dark skin patches on the face (melasma). Research suggests that applying a solution containing zinc to the skin daily for 2 months is less effective than standard skin bleaching treatment for people with brown patches on the face.
Heart attack. Early research shows that taking zinc twice daily for 9 months helps the heart to beat more effectively in people who have had a heart attack.
Cancer of the upper part of the throat behind the nose (nasopharyngeal cancer). Early research suggests that taking zinc improves survival rates after 5 years in people with a rare type of advanced nose and throat cancer.
Yellowing of the skin in infants (neonatal jaundice). Early research suggests that taking zinc twice daily for 7 days does not improve jaundice in newborns.
Injury to the brain, spine, or nerves (neurological trauma). Administering zinc immediately after a head trauma seems to improve the rate of recovery.
Cancer that starts in white blood cells (non-Hodgkin lymphoma). Early research suggests that zinc supplementation is linked to a decreased risk of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
A type of anxiety marked by recurrent thoughts and repetitive behaviors (obsessive-compulsive disorder or OCD). Early research suggests that taking zinc twice daily along with the drug fluoxetine for 8 weeks reduces OCD symptoms slightly more than taking fluoxetine alone.
Swelling (inflammation) and sores inside the mouth (oral mucositis). Research shows that taking zinc sulfate by mouth while undergoing radiation therapy helps prevent ulcers and swelling in the mouth caused by radiation treatments. Some research shows that taking zinc sulfate by mouth reduces the severity of mouth ulcers in adults undergoing chemotherapy. However, taking zinc does appear to improve mouth ulcers caused by chemotherapy in children and adolescents. Zinc does not appear to reduce mouth ulcers in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).
A hormonal disorder that causes enlarged ovaries with cysts (polycystic ovary syndrome or PCOS). Some research shows that taking zinc helps prevent hair loss on the head and hair growth on the face in women with PCOS who are also taking a medication called metformin. Taking zinc does not seem to improve acne or levels of hormones in the body.
Recovery after surgery. Early research suggests that taking zinc reduces the healing time after surgery used to treat an abnormal skin growth located at the tailbone (pilonidal surgery).
Swelling (inflammation) of the prostate due to infection. Taking zinc along with the drug prazosin does not seem to improve the ability to urinate or quality of life compared to taking prazosin alone in men with prostate swelling. But zinc might help to relive pain in some people with this condition.
Itching. Early research suggests that taking zinc twice daily for 2 months reduces itching in people with kidney disease who are experiencing itching due to dialysis treatment.
Seizures. Febrile seizures are seizures that occur during a fever. Taking zinc might prevent these seizures in children who already experienced one.
Blood infection (sepsis). Taking zinc along with antibiotics might protect the brain of newborns with sepsis. It isn't known if taking zinc can help these babies live longer.
Infections of the kidney, bladder, or urethra (urinary tract infections or UTIs). Early research shows that taking zinc helps to improve some symptoms of a bladder infection faster in children who are also taking antibiotics. Taking zinc might reduce how often they need to go to the bathroom. It doesn't seem to help with fever or to kill the bacteria in the bladder.
Wound healing. Early research suggests that applying a zinc solution twice daily improves wound healing compared to applying a saline solution. However, applying zinc-containing insulin (Humulin by Eli Lilly and Company) seems to work better than solution containing zinc alone.
A type of inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn disease).
A type of inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis).
Skin wrinkles from sun damage.

More evidence is needed to rate zinc for these uses.",how effective is it,Zinc,How effective is Zinc ?,Drugs
MPlusHerbsSupplements,https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/982.html,"Zinc is needed for the proper growth and maintenance of the human body.  It is found in several systems and biological reactions, and it is needed for immune function, wound healing, blood clotting, thyroid function, and much more.  Meats, seafood, dairy products, nuts, legumes, and whole grains offer relatively high levels of zinc.

Zinc deficiency is not uncommon worldwide, but is rare in the US. Symptoms include slowed growth, low insulin levels, loss of appetite, irritability, generalized hair loss, rough and dry skin, slow wound healing, poor sense of taste and smell, diarrhea, and nausea.  Moderate zinc deficiency is associated with disorders of the intestine which interfere with food absorption (malabsorption syndromes), alcoholism, chronic kidney failure, and chronic debilitating diseases.

Zinc plays a key role in maintaining vision, and it is present in high concentrations in the eye.  Zinc deficiency can alter vision, and severe deficiency can cause changes in the retina (the back of the eye where an image is focused).

Zinc might also have effects against viruses.  It appears to lessen symptoms of the rhinovirus (common cold), but researchers can't yet explain exactly how this works.  In addition, there is some evidence that zinc has some antiviral activity against the herpes virus.
Low zinc levels can be associated with male infertility, sickle cell disease, HIV, major depression, and type 2 diabetes, and can be fought by taking a zinc supplement.",how does it work,Zinc,What is the action of Zinc and how does it work ?,Drugs
MPlusHerbsSupplements,https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/982.html,"When taken by mouth: Zinc is LIKELY SAFE for most adults when taken by mouth in amounts not larger than 40 mg daily. Routine zinc supplementation is not recommended without the advice of a healthcare professional. In some people, zinc might cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, metallic taste, kidney and stomach damage, and other side effects. Zinc is POSSIBLY SAFE when taken by mouth in doses greater than 40 mg daily, especially when these doses are taken only for a short period of time. There is some concern that taking doses higher than 40 mg daily might decrease how much copper the body absorbs. Decreased copper absorption may cause anemia. Taking high amounts of zinc is LIKELY UNSAFE. High doses above the recommended amounts might cause fever, coughing, stomach pain, fatigue, and many other problems. Taking more than 100 mg of supplemental zinc daily or taking supplemental zinc for 10 or more years doubles the risk of developing prostate cancer. There is also concern that taking large amounts of a multivitamin plus a separate zinc supplement increases the chance of dying from prostate cancer. Taking 450 mg or more of zinc daily can cause problems with blood iron. Single doses of 10-30 grams of zinc can be fatal.
When applied to the skin: Zinc is LIKELY SAFE for most adults when applied to the skin. Using zinc on broken skin may cause burning, stinging, itching, and tingling.
When inhaled: Zinc is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when inhaled through the nose, as it might cause permanent loss of smell. In June 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advised consumers not to use certain zinc-containing nose sprays (Zicam) after receiving over 100 reports of loss of smell. The maker of these zinc-containing nose sprays has also received several hundred reports of loss of smell from people who had used the products. Avoid using nose sprays containing zinc.


Special precautions & warnings:
Infants and children: Zinc is LIKELY SAFE when taken by mouth appropriately in the recommended amounts. Zinc is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used in high doses.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Zinc is LIKELY SAFE for most pregnant and breast-feeding women when used in the recommended daily amounts (RDA). However, zinc is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when used in high doses by breast-feeding women and LIKELY UNSAFE when used in high doses by pregnant women. Pregnant women over 18 should not take more than 40 mg of zinc per day; pregnant women age 14 to 18 should not take more than 34 mg per day. Breast-feeding women over 18 should not take more than 40 mg of zinc per day; breast-feeding women age 14 to 18 should not take more than 34 mg per day.
Alcoholism: Long-term, excessive alcohol drinking is linked to poor zinc absorption in the body.
Diabetes:  Large doses of zinc can lower blood sugar in people with diabetes. People with diabetes should use zinc products cautiously. 
Hemodialysis: People receiving hemodialysis treatments seem to be at risk for zinc deficiency and might require zinc supplements.
HIV (human immunodeficiency virus)/AIDS: Use zinc cautiously if you have HIV/AIDS. Zinc use has been linked to shorter survival time in people with HIV/AIDs.
Syndromes in which it is difficult for the body to absorb nutrients: People with malabsorption syndromes may be zinc deficient.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA): People with RA absorb less zinc.
Vegetarianism: Vegetarian diets are often linked with lower zinc absorption. So this type of diet is considered a risk factor for zinc depletion. But the body adapts over the long term. It becomes better at absorbing zinc and reducing zinc loss. 
",precautions,Zinc,Are there safety concerns or special precautions about Zinc ?,Drugs
MPlusHerbsSupplements,https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/982.html,"ModerateBe cautious with this combination.Antibiotics (Quinolone antibiotics)Zinc might decrease how much antibiotic the body absorbs from the gut. Taking zinc along with some antibiotics might decrease the effectiveness of some antibiotics. To avoid this interaction, take antibiotics at least 2 hours before or 4-6 hours after zinc supplements.

Some of these antibiotics that might interact with zinc include ciprofloxacin (Cipro), gemifloxacin (Factive), levofloxacin (Levaquin), moxifloxacin (Avelox), and others.Antibiotics (Tetracycline antibiotics)Zinc can attach to tetracyclines in the stomach. This decreases the amount of tetracyclines that can be absorbed. Taking zinc with tetracyclines might decrease the effectiveness of tetracyclines. To avoid this interaction, take tetracyclines 2 hours before or 4-6 hours after taking zinc supplements.
Some tetracyclines include demeclocycline (Declomycin), minocycline (Minocin), and tetracycline (Achromycin, Sumycin).Atazanavir (Reyataz)Atazanavir (Reyataz) is a drug used for HIV infection. Zinc decreases how much atazanavir (Reyataz) the body absorbs. But the body still absorbs enough atazanavir (Reyataz) for atazanavir to work for treating HIV. So this interaction is probably not a big concern.Cephalexin (Keflex)Cephalexin (Keflex) is an antibiotic used to treat infections. Zinc can reduce how much cephalexin (Keflex) the body absorbs if taken at the same time or 3 hours before cephalexin (Keflex). This might decrease how well cephalexin (Keflex) works for treating infections. But taking zinc 3 hours after taking cephalexin (Keflex) doesn't affect how much cephalexin (Keflex) the body absorbs. Therefore, zinc should be taken 3 hours after taking cephalexin (Keflex).Cisplatin (Platinol-AQ)Cisplatin (Platinol-AQ) is used to treat cancer. Taking zinc along with EDTA and cisplatin (Platinol-AQ) might inactivate cisplatin (Platinol-AQ) therapy.  It is not known for sure, though, if the amount of interference caused by zinc is significant.Medications for diabetes (Antidiabetes drugs)Zinc might decrease blood sugar in people with type 2 diabetes. Diabetes medications are also used to lower blood sugar. Taking zinc along with diabetes medications might cause your blood sugar to go too low. Monitor your blood sugar closely. The dose of your diabetes medication might need to be changed.
Some medications used for diabetes include glimepiride (Amaryl), glyburide (DiaBeta, Glynase PresTab, Micronase), insulin, pioglitazone (Actos), rosiglitazone (Avandia), chlorpropamide (Diabinese), glipizide (Glucotrol), tolbutamide (Orinase), and others.Medications for HIV/AIDS (Integrase inhibitors)Taking zinc along with integrase inhibitors might decrease blood levels of integrase inhibitors. This might decrease their effectiveness. Talk to your healthcare provider if you are using integrase inhibitors and want to start taking zinc. Integrase inhibitors include dolutegravir (Tivicay), elvitegravir (Vitekta), and raltegravir (Isentress).PenicillaminePenicillamine is used for Wilson disease  and rheumatoid arthritis. Zinc might decrease how much penicillamine your body absorbs and decrease the effectiveness of penicillamine. Take zinc and penicillamine at least 2 hours apart.Ritonavir (Norvir)Ritonavir (Norvir) is a drug used for HIV infection. Zinc can reduce how much ritonavir (Norvir) the body absorbs. But this doesn't seem to decrease the effects of ritonavir very much. So this interaction is probably not a big concern.MinorBe watchful with this combination.Amiloride (Midamor)Amiloride (Midamor) is used as a ""water pill"" to help remove excess water from the body. Another effect of amiloride (Midamor) is that it can increase the amount of zinc in the body.

However, there are no reports of this interaction.CalciumCalcium supplements might decrease dietary zinc absorption. This usually doesn't seem to be much of a problem. However, this interaction can be avoided by taking calcium supplements at bedtime instead of with meals.ChromiumThere is early evidence that chromium and zinc could each reduce the absorption of the other. This is probably not a problem when usual supplemental doses of zinc and chromium are taken.CopperLarge amounts of zinc can reduce copper absorption. Taking zinc in high doses can cause significant copper deficiency and anemia, a condition in which the blood cannot carry enough oxygen. Some signs of copper deficiency have also occurred in people taking 150 mg/day or more of zinc for 2 years.EDTAEDTA is a chemical compound that is given to people to remove excess metals in their systems, especially lead. EDTA works by binding with (chelating) the metal. Repeated high doses of EDTA, as used in chelation treatment, can reduce blood zinc levels by up to 40%.  Symptoms of zinc depletion have been reported, even when supplemental zinc (15mg/day) was given. People receiving chelation therapy should be monitored for zinc depletion.Folic acidStudies on the effects of folic acid supplements on dietary zinc absorption are conflicting. Normal supplemental doses of folic acid are not likely to affect zinc balance in people with adequate dietary zinc intake.Herbs and supplements that might lower blood sugarLarge amounts of zinc might lower blood sugar. Using it along with other herbs and supplements that have the same effect might cause blood sugar to drop too low in some people. Some of these alpha-lipoic acid, bitter melon, chromium, devil's claw, fenugreek, garlic, guar gum, horse chestnut, Panax ginseng, psyllium, Siberian ginseng, and others.IP-6 (Phytic acid)Phytic acid found naturally in foods can bind zinc and reduce its absorption;. howeverHowever, zinc deficiency due to high dietary phytic acid levels has not been reported in Western populations. Avoid IP-6 supplements, which contain phytic acid, if you have other risk factors for zinc deficiency.IronUnder some circumstances, iron and zinc can interfere with each other's absorption. To avoid this effect, take these supplements with food.MagnesiumHigh doses of zinc supplements (142 mg/day), or high dietary zinc intake (53mg/day) seem to decrease magnesium balance.

Researchers aren't sure why this happens or how important the interaction may be.Calcium-containing foodsCalcium can decrease zinc absorption. The risk of losing too much zinc isn't significant unless lots of dairy products are consumed along with calcium supplements. However, the body adapts over the long term, becoming more efficient at absorbing zinc and reducing zinc losses.Fiber-containing foodsEating fiber can reduce zinc absorption. However, over time the body adapts to increased dietary fiber by increasing zinc absorption.Phytate-containing foodsPhytate is a molecule found in grains (e.g., maize, corn, sorghum), legumes, seeds (e.g., sunflower, pumpkin), and soy. Phytate can reduce zinc absorption. Some foods with higher phytate contents also have a higher zinc content (for example, whole wheat vs. white bread), canceling out the effect in zinc absorption. Some people in Middle Eastern countries have zinc deficiencies because they eat unleavened bread and maize, which contain phytate. People in Western populations most at risk are those with diets high in unrefined grains, legumes, soy protein, and calcium, and low in animal protein. However, the body adapts over the long term, becoming more efficient at absorbing zinc and reducing zinc losses.Protein-containing foodsZinc binds to proteins, becoming available for absorption as the protein is digested. The type of protein influences how much zinc is absorbed. Animal proteins generally increase zinc absorption, although a protein in cow's milk slows absorption down. Soy proteins also reduce zinc absorption, possibly due to their phytate content. These effects can influence zinc balance in infants; babies get the most zinc from mother's milk, less from cow's milk, and even less from soy-based milk. It isn't known whether high-protein diets influence zinc balance in adults.",interactions with foods,Zinc,Are there interactions between Zinc and foods ?,Drugs

MPlusHerbsSupplements,https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/1017.html,"Folate and folic acid are forms of a water-soluble B vitamin. Folate occurs naturally in food, and folic acid is the synthetic form of this vitamin. Since 1998, folic acid has been added to cold cereals, flour, breads, pasta, bakery items, cookies, and crackers, as required by federal law. Foods that are naturally high in folate include leafy vegetables (such as spinach, broccoli, and lettuce), okra, asparagus, fruits (such as bananas, melons, and lemons) beans, yeast, mushrooms, meat (such as beef liver and kidney), orange juice, and tomato juice.

Folic acid is used for preventing and treating low blood levels of folate (folate deficiency) and high blood levels of homocysteine (hyperhomocysteinemia). Women who are pregnant or might become pregnant take folic acid to prevent miscarriage and ""neural tube defects."" These are serious birth defects such as spina bifida, when the fetal spine and back do not close in the womb. Folic acid is also used for many other conditions including depression, stroke, decline in memory and thinking skills in older people that is more than what is normal for their age, and many others. 

Folic acid is often used in combination with other B vitamins.

Taking folic acid improves folate deficiency.Likely effective for...Serious kidney disease (end-stage renal disease or ESRD). About 85% of people with serious kidney disease have high levels of homocysteine. High levels of homocysteine have been linked to heart disease and stroke. Taking folic acid lowers homocysteine levels in people with serious kidney disease. However, folic acid supplementation does not appear to reduce the risk of heart disease-related events.
High amounts of homocysteine in the blood (hyperhomocysteinemia). High levels of homocysteine have been linked to heart disease and stroke. Taking folic acid lowers homocysteine levels by 20% to 30% in people with normal to slightly elevated homocysteine levels. It is recommended that people with homocysteine levels greater than 11 micromoles/L supplement with folic acid and vitamin B12.
Toxicity caused by the drug methotrexate. Taking folic acid seems to reduce nausea and vomiting, which are possible side effects of methotrexate treatment.
Birth defects of the brain and spine (neural tube birth defects). Folic acid during pregnancy reduces the risk of neural tube birth defects. It is recommended that pregnant women get 600-800 mcg of folic acid per day from their diet or supplements starting 1 month before pregnancy and during pregnancy. Pregnant women with a history of neural tube birth defects are advised to get 4000 mcg of folic acid per day.Possibly effective for...An eye disease that leads to vision loss in older adults (age-related macular degeneration or AMD). Research shows that taking folic acid with other vitamins including vitamin B6 and vitamin B12 reduces the risk of developing age-related vision loss.
Decline in memory and thinking skills in older people that is more than what is normal for their age. Research shows that taking folic acid with or without other B vitamins may improve memory and thinking skills in older people with larger than normal declines in these skills. Folic acid seems to work best in people who have low levels of folate or high levels of homocysteine in the blood.
Depression. Limited research shows  that taking folic acid along with antidepressants seems to improve symptoms in people with depression.
High blood pressure. Research shows that taking folic acid daily for at least 6 weeks reduces blood pressure in people with high blood pressure. But Taking folic acid with blood pressure medication does not seem to lower blood pressure more than taking only blood pressure medicine 
Gum enlargement caused by the drug phenytoin. Applying folic acid to the gums seems to prevent gum problems caused by phenytoin. However, taking folic acid by mouth does not seem to improve symptoms of this condition.
Gum disease in women who are pregnant. Applying folic acid to the gums seems to improve gum disease during pregnancy.
Stroke. Taking folic acid can reduce the risk of stroke by 10% to 25% in people who live in countries that don't fortify grain products with folic acid. But folic acid doesn't seem to prevent strokes in most people who live in countries that do fortify grain products with folic acid.
A skin disorder that causes white patches to develop on the skin (vitiligo). Taking folic acid by mouth seems to improve symptoms of vitiligo.
Possibly ineffective for...
Low levels of healthy red blood cells (anemia) due to iron deficiency. Taking folic acid with iron supplements is not more effective than taking the iron supplements without folic acid for treating and preventing iron deficiency and anemia caused by too little iron in the body.
Decline in memory and thinking skills that occurs normally with age. Most research shows that taking folic acid does not prevent decline in memory and thinking skills in the elderly. 
A procedure to open a blocked or narrowed blood vessel (angioplasty). There is inconsistent evidence on the benefits of taking folic acid after a procedure to widen the blood vessels. But taking folic acid plus vitamin B6 and vitamin B12 might actually interfere with healing in cases where a device (stent) is inserted in the blood vessel to keep it open.
Breast cancer. Consuming folate in the diet might lower the risk of developing breast cancer in women who also eat high amounts of methionine, vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin), or vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), but research is not consistent. Other research suggests that taking folic acid supplements alone does not lower the risk of breast cancer.
Cataracts. Research shows that taking folic acid with other vitamins including vitamin B6 and vitamin B12 does not prevent cataracts. In fact, it might increase the chance of needing to have cataracts removed.
Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Daily injections of folic acid appear to have no effect on symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome.
Diarrhea. Taking a specific nutritional supplement with added folic acid and possibly vitamin B12 does not seem to prevent diarrhea in children at risk of malnutrition. Taking this product may increase the risk of having diarrhea last more than a few days.
Fall prevention. Taking folic acid with vitamin B-12 does not seem to prevent falls in older people who are also taking vitamin D. 
Death of an unborn or premature baby. Taking folic acid during pregnancy does not seem to reduce the risk of having a baby die just before or after birth.
Cancer of the white blood cells (leukemia). Taking folate during pregnancy does not reduce the risk of childhood cancer of the white blood cells.

Weak and brittle bones (osteoporosis). In elderly individuals with osteoporosis, taking folic acid with vitamin B12 and possibly vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) does not seem to prevent broken bones.
Physical performance in elderly adults. Taking folic acid with vitamin B-12 doesn't seem to help older people walk better or have stronger hands.
Infection of the airways. Taking a specific nutritional supplement with added folic acid and possibly vitamin B12 does not seem to prevent infections in the lungs in children at risk of malnutrition.
Likely ineffective for...Non-cancerous growths in the large intestine and rectum (colorectal adenoma). Taking folic acid supplements does not seem to prevent growths in the large intestine or rectum.
An inherited condition marked by learning disabilities (fragile-X syndrome). Taking folic acid by mouth does not improve symptoms of fragile-X-syndrome.
Preterm birth. Taking folic acid during pregnancy does not decrease the risk of having a premature baby. 
Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Alzheimer disease. Some limited evidence has found that elderly people who consume more folic acid in the diet or from supplements appear to have a lower risk of developing Alzheimer disease than people who consume less folic acid. But this has not been confirmed in good quality studies. Early research also shows that taking folic acid along with other B vitamins might slow declines in memory, thinking, behavior, and activities of daily living in people with Alzheimer disease who are taking drugs for Alzheimer disease called cholinesterase inhibitors.
Autism. Limited research suggests taking folic acid during pregnancy might reduce the risk of autism in the child.
A blood disorder that reduces levels of protein in the blood called hemoglobin (beta-thalassemia). Beta-thalassemia is a disorder of the blood that results in the production of less hemoglobin, the protein that carries oxygen in the blood. Patients with beta-thalassemia usually have bone and muscle pain and have less strength. In children with this disorder, limited research suggests taking folic acid by itself, or with L-carnitine a compound similar to an amino acid from protein, might reduce bone pain and help increase strength.
Bipolar disorder. Taking folic acid does not appear to improve the antidepressant effects of lithium in people with bipolar disorder. However, taking folate with the medication valproate improves the effects of valproate.
Heart disease. Some research shows that taking folic acid doesn't reduce the risk of death in people with heart disease. But it might reduce the risk of stroke in people with this condition.
Cancer of the cervix. There is some evidence that increasing folic acid and folate intake from dietary and supplement sources, along with thiamine, riboflavin, and vitamin B12, might help to prevent cancer of the cervix.
Child development. Some research shows that taking folic acid supplements during the last 22 weeks of pregnancy may improve the child's mental function during childhood.
Long-term kidney disease (chronic kidney disease or CKD). Taking folic acid might help slow kidney function decline in people with CKD. But it is not beneficial when used along with vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin). In fact, this combination might make kidney disease worse.
Colon cancer, rectal cancer. Research suggests that taking folic acid or eating folate in the diet can reduce the risk of developing colon or rectal cancer. However, there is some research that does not suggest that taking folic acid or folate in the diet offers the same benefit. It is possible that folic acid may be more helpful for preventing colon cancer than rectal cancer or it may be more helpful for specific kinds of colon cancer.
Heart problems at birth. Women who take folic acid or prenatal vitamins containing folic acid have a lower chance of giving birth to babies with heart problems.
Diseases, such as Alzheimer disease, that interfere with thinking (dementia). Some research shows that folic acid might help prevent or treat Alzheimer disease. But other early research shows that it might not be useful for treating other types of dementia.
Diabetes. Taking folic acid supplements does not seem to benefit people with diabetes. 
Epilepsy. Taking folic acid does not reduce seizures in people with epilepsy. But some early research suggests that folic acid might reduce seizures in children that are deficient in folic acid. 
Cancer of the esophagus. Research suggests that consuming more folate in the diet lowers the risk for developing cancer of the esophagus.
High amounts of homocysteine in the blood caused by the drug fenofibrate. Taking folic acid every other day might lower levels of homocysteine in the blood caused by the drug fenofibrate.
Stomach cancer. Research suggests that taking folic acid reduces the risk of developing some types of stomach cancer.
Gout. Early research suggests that folate might reduce the risk of gout.
Head and neck cancer. Getting more folic acid from the diet has been linked to a lower risk of head and neck cancer. 
Hearing loss. Low levels of folate in the blood seem to be related to the risk for sudden hearing loss in adults. Some evidence suggests that taking folic acid daily for 3 years slows the decline of hearing loss in older people who have low folate levels. It is not clear if folic acid supplementation reduces hearing loss in people with normal folate levels.
Infants born weighing less than 2500 grams (5 pounds, 8 ounces). Taking folic acid during pregnancy does not prevent some babies from being born at a low birth weight but it does seem to increase the overall average of birth weights. However, some early research suggests that taking folic acid before getting pregnant might reduce the risk of having a baby that is too small even when born full term. Although this risk is not reduced in mothers that start supplementation after the baby is conceived.
Lung cancer. There does not appear to be a relationship between low levels of folic acid and lung cancer in most people.
The most serious type of skin cancer (melanoma). Early research shows that taking folic acid might reduce the risk of melanoma.
Reduced benefit of nitrate therapy that happens when nitrates are used all day (nitrate tolerance). Some evidence suggests that taking folic acid does not help medications for chest pain (nitrates) work longer.
Cleft lip and cleft palate. Some research suggests that taking folic acid during pregnancy lowers the risk of cleft lip. However, other research shows no effect.
Pancreatic cancer. Eating more than 280 mcg of folate in the diet daily is linked to a lower risk of developing pancreatic cancer. However, other research suggests that folate intake is not linked to pancreatic cancer risk.
A type of throat cancer (pharyngeal cancer). Limited research suggests folic acid and folate from dietary and sources and supplements may protect against oropharyngeal cancer, a specific type of throat cancer.
A pregnancy complication marked by high blood pressure and protein in the urine (pre-eclampsia). Pre-eclampsia is marked by high blood pressure and protein in the urine during pregnancy. Research regarding whether folic acid reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia is conflicting.
High blood pressure during pregnancy. Limited research found that taking folic acid during pregnancy does not reduce the risk of high blood pressure.
A disorder that causes leg discomfort and an irresistible urge to move the legs (restless legs syndrome or RLS). Taking folic acid seems to reduce symptoms of restless legs syndrome. Researchers are studying whether folic acid deficiency causes restless legs syndrome.
Schizophrenia. Taking a combination of folic acid and vitamin B12 may reduce some of the negative symptoms associated with schizophrenia, but only in some patients with a specific genetic make-up. In most people, folic acid does not help with these symptoms.
Sickle-cell disease. Taking folic acid might lower homocysteine levels. However, it is not known if this will benefit people with sickle-cell disease.
Acne.
Alcoholism.
Eczema (atopic dermatitis).

MPlusHerbsSupplements,https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/747.html,"Glucosamine is an amino sugar that is produced naturally in humans. It is also found in seashells, or it can be made in the laboratory. Glucosamine hydrochloride is one of several forms of glucosamine.


It is important to read the labels of glucosamine products carefully since several different forms of glucosamine are sold as supplements. These products may contain glucosamine sulfate, glucosamine hydrochloride, or N-acetyl glucosamine. These different chemicals have some similarities. But they may not have the same effects when taken as a dietary supplement. Most of the scientific research on glucosamine has been done using glucosamine sulfate. See the separate listing for glucosamine sulfate. The information on this page is about glucosamine hydrochloride.

Dietary supplements that contain glucosamine often contain additional ingredients. These additional ingredients are frequently chondroitin sulfate, MSM, or shark cartilage. Some people think these combinations work better than taking just glucosamine alone. So far, researchers have found no proof that combining the additional ingredients with glucosamine adds any benefit.

Products that contain glucosamine and glucosamine plus chondroitin vary a great deal. Some do not contain what the label claims. The difference can range from 25% to 115%. Some products in the US that are labeled glucosamine sulfate are actually glucosamine hydrochloride with added sulfate. This product will likely have different effects than one containing glucosamine sulfate.

Glucosamine hydrochloride is used for osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, glaucoma, a jaw disorder called temporomandibular disorder (TMD), joint pain, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.",information,Glucosamine hydrochloride,What is Glucosamine hydrochloride ?,Drugs

Heart disease. People who take glucosamine might have a lower risk of developing heart disease. But it's unclear what dose or form of glucosamine might work best. Other forms of glucosamine include glucosamine sulfate and N-acetyl glucosamine. It's also unclear if this lower risk is from glucosamine or from following healthier lifestyle habits. 
High levels of cholesterol or other fats (lipids) in the blood (hyperlipidemia). Early research suggests that glucosamine hydrochloride does not affect cholesterol or triglyceride levels in people with high cholesterol. 
A disorder that affects the bones and joints, usually in people with selenium deficiency (Kashin-Beck disease). Early evidence shows that taking glucosamine hydrochloride along with chondroitin sulfate reduces pain and improves physical function in adults with a bone and joint disorder called Kashin-Beck disease. The effects of glucosamine sulfate on symptoms of Kashin-Beck disease are mixed when the supplement is taken as a single agent.
Knee pain. There is some early evidence that glucosamine hydrochloride might relieve pain for some people with frequent knee pain. But other research shows that taking glucosamine hydrochloride along with other ingredients does not relieve pain or improve walking ability in people with knee pain.
Osteoarthritis. There is conflicting evidence about the effectiveness of glucosamine hydrochloride for osteoarthritis. Most of the evidence supporting the use of glucosamine hydrochloride comes from studies of a particular product (CosaminDS). This product contains a combination of glucosamine hydrochloride, chondroitin sulfate, and manganese ascorbate. Some evidence suggests that this combination can improve pain in people with knee osteoarthritis. This combination might work better in people with mild-to-moderate osteoarthritis than in people with severe osteoarthritis. Another product (Gurukosamin & Kondoroichin) containing glucosamine hydrochloride, chondroitin sulfate, and quercetin glycosides also seems to improve knee osteoarthritis symptoms.



The effects of taking glucosamine hydrochloride along with only chondroitin sulfate are mixed. Some evidence shows that taking a specific product (Droglican) containing glucosamine hydrochloride and chondroitin sulfate reduces pain in adults with knee osteoarthritis. However, other research shows that formulas containing glucosamine hydrochloride and chondroitin sulfate are not effective at reducing pain in patients with knee osteoarthritis.



Most research suggests that taking glucosamine hydrochloride alone does not reduce pain in people with osteoarthritis of the knee.

More research has been done on glucosamine sulfate (see separate listing) than on glucosamine hydrochloride. There is some thought that glucosamine sulfate may be more effective than glucosamine hydrochloride for osteoarthritis. Most research comparing the two forms of glucosamine showed no difference. However, some researchers have criticized the quality of some of these studies.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Early research shows that taking a specific glucosamine hydrochloride product (Rohto Pharmaceuticals Co.) in combination with prescription medical treatments reduces pain compared to a sugar pill. However, this product does not seem to decrease inflammation or reduce the number of painful or swollen joints.
Stroke. People who take glucosamine might have a slightly lower risk of having a stroke. But it's unclear what dose or form of glucosamine might work best. Other forms of glucosamine include glucosamine sulfate and N-acetyl glucosamine. It's also unclear if this lower risk is from glucosamine or from following healthier lifestyle habits.
A group of painful conditions that affect the jaw joint and muscle (temporomandibular disorders or TMD). Early research shows that taking a combination of glucosamine hydrochloride, chondroitin sulfate, and calcium ascorbate twice daily reduces joint swelling and pain, as well as noise made at the jaw joint, in people with temporomandibular disorder.

These are ""friendly"" bacteria that normally live in our digestive, urinary, and genital systems without causing disease. Lactobacillus is also in some fermented foods like yogurt and in dietary supplements.

Lactobacillus is most commonly taken by mouth to treat and prevent diarrhea, including infectious diarrhea and diarrhea linked with using antibiotics. Some people also take lactobacillus by mouth for general digestion problems, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), colic in babies, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), inflammation of the colon, stomach pain, constipation, and many other conditions but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these uses.

Stomach pain. Taking lactobacillus short-term seems to reduce symptoms in children with stomach pain. Early research also shows that taking lactobacillus and bifidobacterium short-term can improve symptoms in women with stomach pain.
Hay fever. Taking 2 billion colony-forming units of lactobacillus daily for 5 weeks can improve quality of life by almost 18% in people with grass pollen allergy that doesn't respond to the anti-allergy drug loratadine. In children with allergies that persist throughout the year, taking 10 billion colony-forming units of lactobacillus for 12 weeks seems to improve itchy eye symptoms. But taking lactobacillus during pregnancy doesn't seem to prevent the infant from developing allergies. 
Diarrhea in people taking antibiotics (antibiotic-associated diarrhea). Taking probiotics products containing lactobacillus strains helps prevent diarrhea caused by antibiotics in adults and children. The most well-studied strain of lactobacillus seems to reduce the chance of diarrhea by about 60% to 70% when started within 2 days of beginning antibiotic treatment and continued for at least 3 days after finishing the antibiotics.
Eczema (atopic dermatitis). Most research shows that taking lactobacillus products can reduce eczema symptoms in infants and children. Research also shows that lactobacillus can help PREVENT eczema from developing. When taken by a mother during the last month of pregnancy, lactobacillus probiotics can reduce the chance of the child developing eczema. But not all strains seem to work.
Prone to allergies and allergic reactions (atopic disease). Research shows that taking certain lactobacillus strains can prevent the development of allergic reactions, such as asthma, runny nose, and eczema, in infants with a family history of this condition. However, not all strains seem to work.
Overgrowth of bacteria in the vagina. Researchers have found that lactobacillus suppositories and vaginal tablets may be effective in treating  this condition. Researchers have also found that eating yogurt or using vaginal capsules containing lactobacillus can help prevent these infections from occurring again. But taking lactobacillus capsules does not seem to prevent bacteria overgrowth in the vagina in pregnant women. 
Diarrhea caused by cancer drug treatment. A chemotherapy drug called 5-fluorouracil can cause severe diarrhea and other gastrointestinal (GI) side effects. There is some evidence that patients with cancer of the colon or rectum have less severe diarrhea, less stomach discomfort, and shorter hospital care when they take lactobacillus.
Excessive crying in infants (colic). Some research shows that giving lactobacillus to nursing infants reduces daily crying time. Some research suggests that lactobacillus is more effective at reducing crying time than using the drug simethicone. But one large study shows that lactobacillus does not reduce crying. It's possible that infants in the large study had more severe colic than those in the earlier research.
Constipation. Taking lactobacillus probiotics for 4-8 weeks can reduce symptoms of constipation including stomach pain and discomfort, bloating, and incomplete bowel movements. It might also increase the number of bowel movements in some people.
Diabetes. Taking lactobacillus starting at the beginning of the second trimester of pregnancy helps to prevent diabetes during pregnancy, especially in mothers over 35 years of age and mothers that had diabetes during another pregnancy. In women who develop diabetes during pregnancy, taking lactobacillus seems to help control blood sugar. In non-pregnant adults with diabetes, some early research shows that lactobacillus reduces sugar in the blood. 
Diarrhea. Giving lactobacillus to infants and children 1-36 months old when they are admitted to the hospital seems to reduce the risk of developing diarrhea. Also, lactobacillus can reduce the risk of diarrhea from all causes in undernourished children. But most research shows that giving lactobacillus to children who already have diarrhea does not help them to get better faster.
A digestive tract infection that can lead to ulcers (Helicobacter pylori or H. pylori). Research shows that taking lactobacillus probiotics along with ""triple therapy"" that consists of the prescription drugs clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and a proton-pump inhibitor helps treat stomach ulcers caused by H. pylori. About 7-11 patients with H. pylori infections need to be treated with lactobacillus plus ""triple therapy"" for one additional patient to achieve remission compared to what would be achieved with ""triple therapy"" alone. But taking lactobacillus probiotics does not help treat the infection when taken alone, with only an antibiotic, with other ""triple therapies,"" or with ""quadruple therapy"" that includes bismuth. It is unclear if lactobacillus can reduce triple therapy-related adverse effects.
High cholesterol. Taking lactobacillus probiotics can lower total cholesterol by about 10 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein (LDL or ""bad"") cholesterol by about 9 mg/dL in people with or without high cholesterol. However, lactobacillus probiotics do not seem to improve high-density lipoprotein (HDL or ""good"") cholesterol or fats called triglycerides.
Swelling (inflammation) and sores inside the mouth (oral mucositis). Research shows that taking lozenges containing lactobacillus from the first day of radiation/chemotherapy treatment until one week after reduces the number of patients who develop severe mouth sores.
A complication after surgery for ulcerative colitis (pouchitis). Taking lactobacillus by mouth seems to help treat pouchitis, a complication of surgery for ulcerative colitis. Taking a probiotic containing lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, and streptococcus for one year seems to maintain remission in 85% of people with this condition. Taking a different formulation containing two lactobacillus species and bifidobacterium for 9 months seems to reduce pouchitis severity.
Infection of the airways. Some research shows that lactobacillus probiotics can help prevent airway infections in infants and children. Giving lactobacillus to infants and children seems to reduce the chance of upper airway infections. Also, children ages 1-6 years who attend daycare centers seem to get fewer and less severe airway infections when given milk containing lactobacillus. However, not all strains seem to work. In adults, drinking fermented milk or taking powder that contains lactobacillus might help prevent airway infections and decrease how long the symptoms last.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Research shows that taking lactobacillus for 8 weeks reduces tender and swollen joints in women with rheumatoid arthritis.
Travelers' diarrhea. Travelers' diarrhea is caused by bacteria, viruses, or parasites that the traveler has not been exposed to before. Taking lactobacillus seems to help prevent diarrhea in travelers. The effectiveness can vary a lot depending on the travel destination because of differences in bacteria in different locations.
A type of inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis). Lactobacillus probiotics seem to increase remission in people with ulcerative colitis. The best evidence of benefit is for a multi-species probiotic containing lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, and streptococcus. Research shows that taking this product can increase remission rates by almost 2-fold when used with standard ulcerative colitis treatment. Taking a single strain of lactobacillus also seems to improve symptoms. But lactobacillus doesn't seem to prevent ulcerative colitis relapse.Possibly ineffective for...Infection of the gastrointestinal tract by a bacteria called Clostridium difficile. People who are treated for Clostridium difficile infections often experience recurrence. Although some conflicting results exist, most research shows that taking lactobacillus does not prevent recurrent episodes of Clostridium difficile diarrhea. Most research also shows that lactobacillus probiotics do not prevent first episodes of Clostridium difficile diarrhea.
Crohn disease. Taking lactobacillus probiotics does not prevent Crohn disease from becoming active again in people who are in remission or in those who have just had surgery for Crohn disease.
Tooth plaque. Giving lactobacillus to pregnant women starting 4 weeks before delivery until birth, and then continuing in the infants until 12 months of age, does not seem to reduce tooth plaque in the baby teeth of the child by the age of 9 years.
Airway infections caused by exercise. Research in trained athletes shows that taking lactobacillus probiotics does not reduce the risk of developing a airway infection. It also does not seem reduce the symptoms of airway infections in athletes.
Vaginal yeast infections. Taking lactobacillus by mouth or eating yogurt enriched with lactobacillus doesn't prevent vaginal yeast infections in women that have used antibiotics. However, symptoms seem to improve if vaginal suppositories containing lactobacillus are used along with conventional treatment.Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Aging skin. Early research shows that taking lactobacillus improves skin moisture and reduces wrinkles. 
Eye strain (asthenopia). Early research shows that taking lactobacillus does not reduce the strain on the eyes caused by monitors and screens. However, in some people who already have a lot of strain on the eyes, taking lactobacillus might help to reduce additional strain and redness.
Asthma. A small clinical study in children with asthma shows that taking lactobacillus slightly reduces asthma severity and increases asthma control.
Bipolar disorder. Taking a probiotic containing lactobacillus and bifidobacterium after being discharged from the hospital might reduce the chance that people with bipolar disorder will need to be readmitted due to worsening of symptoms.
Common cold. Early research shows that taking lactobacillus daily for 12 weeks reduces the risk of common cold by about 12% and reduces the number of days with symptoms from 8.6 to 6.2 in adults. Also, taking lactobacillus plus bifidobacterium for 3 months seems to reduce school absences due to cold symptoms. However, research is inconsistent. Taking some lactobacillus strains does not seem to reduce the risk of catching a cold or the number of cold/flu days.
Cystic fibrosis. Research suggests that taking lactobacillus daily for 6 months reduces the percentage of cystic fibrosis patients with lung complications from 37% to 3% and the percentage with upper respiratory tract infections from 20% to 3%.
Cavities. Giving lactobacillus to pregnant women starting 4 weeks before delivery until birth, and then continuing in the infants until 12 months of age, helps to prevent cavities in the child's baby teeth. But giving lactobacillus to infants does not prevent cavities in teeth. 
Depression. Early research in patients with major depression shows that taking lactobacillus plus bifidobacteria for 8 weeks seems to improve symptoms of depression.
Inflammation of small pouches on the intestine wall (diverticulitis). Early research in people with this diverticulitis shows that taking lactobacillus along with antibiotics reduces pain and time spent in the hospital. 
Fractures. Early research shows that taking lactobacillus improves hand function and pain after fracture in elderly people. 
Genital herpes. Early research in patients with genital herpes shows that applying lactobacillus in the vagina may reduce symptoms of genital herpes. Higher quality research is needed to confirm these results. 
High levels of fats called triglycerides in the blood (hypertriglyceridemia). Some research in people with this condition shows that taking lactobacillus modestly reduces triglycerides in the blood. 
Flu (influenza). Taking a drink containing one strain of lactobacillus 5 days weekly for 8 weeks reduces the incidence of the flu in schoolchildren during flu season. Taking a different lactobacillus strain daily for 6 weeks does not reduce the number of cold/flu days in otherwise healthy adults.
A long-term disorder of the large intestines that causes stomach pain (irritable bowel syndrome or IBS). Many studies have evaluated lactobacillus species for treating IBS. Some strains might reduce IBS symptoms including abdominal pain, bloating, and gas in some people. But other lactobacillus strains don't seem to work in most people with IBS. Lactobacillus strains also might work better for specific types of IBS. 
Inability to properly digest the sugar lactose (lactose intolerance). Some research shows that drinking milk with lactobacillus still causes symptoms, like gas, in people with lactose intolerance. But other research shows that drinking a milk product containing lactobacillus reduces symptoms of lactose intolerance.
Infants born weighing less than 2500 grams (5 pounds, 8 ounces). Supplementing feed with lactobacillus in very low birth weight infants is not linked to improved movement or mental abilities at two years of age. 
Swelling of breast tissue (mastitis). Early research in pregnant women shows that taking lactobacillus reduces breast tissue swelling involving an infection. 
A grouping of symptoms that increase the risk of diabetes, heart disease, and stroke (metabolic syndrome). Early research shows that taking lactobacillus doesn't improve weight, blood pressure, blood sugar, or lipid levels in people with this condition. 
A serious intestinal disease in premature infants (necrotizing enterocolitis or NEC). When results from multiple clinical studies are evaluated, giving lactobacillus to preterm infants seems to reduce the risk of severe NEC by 30% to 55%. But when results from individual clinical studies are considered, lactobacillus does not seem to prevent NEC. It's possible that the individual clinical studies are too small to show benefit. It's also possible that lactobacillus may be more beneficial when used along with other probiotics than when used as a single probiotic.
Obesity. Research shows that taking lactobacillus does not reduce fat or weight in most obese adults. But it might reduce body weight in women.
A serious gum infection (periodontitis). Early research shows that taking a lactobacillus lozenge doesn't improve gum health in people with this condition. 
Skin rash caused by sun exposure (polymorphous light eruption or PMLE). Early research shows that taking a supplement containing lactobacillus and other ingredients reduces how severe skin reactions are after sun exposure in people with a disorder called polymorphous light eruption.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Early research in people with moderate-to-severe RA shows that taking lactobacillus plus bifidobacteria does not reduce symptom severity or lessen joint pain.
Diarrhea caused by rotavirus. Some small studies show that certain lactobacillus strains can help some children with rotaviral diarrhea get over their diarrhea up to 3 days sooner. But other research shows that giving lactobacillus to children with rotaviral diarrhea does not help them to get better faster. More research is needed to understand which strains, if any, can help with this condition. Also, more research is needed to determine if lactobacillus has different effects in children who have been given rotavirus vaccine compared with those who have not.
Excessive growth of bacteria in the small intestines. Some clinical research has evaluated lactobacillus for treating and preventing the growth of potentially harmful bacteria in the intestines. Some of this research shows slight improvements in symptoms such as stomach pain, bloating, and diarrhea. But other research has found no benefit in people with this condition. Lactobacillus does not seem to be helpful for preventing growth of harmful bacteria in the intestines.
Stress. Early research shows that taking lactobacillus reduces stress and sleep problems in students preparing for exams. 
Infections of the kidney, bladder, or urethra (urinary tract infections or UTIs). There is some early evidence that taking lactobacillus by mouth or putting it on the vagina might be helpful for preventing UTIs. However, not all strains seem to work, and not all studies agree.
Pneumonia in people on breathing machines in the hospital. Early research shows that taking lactobacillus might reduce the incidence of pneumonia in people in the intensive care unit.

Other research shows that it does not improve muscle or development when taken from infancy until 3-4 years of age. Research also shows that taking 5-HTP along with conventional prescription drugs does improve development, social skills, or language skills.
Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Alcohol use disorder. Early research shows that taking 5-HTP with D-phenylalanine and L-glutamine for 40 days can reduce alcohol withdrawal symptoms. However, taking 5-HTP with carbidopa daily for one year does not seem to help people stop drinking. The effect of 5-HTP alone for alcoholism is not clear. 
Alzheimer disease. Early research suggests that taking 5-HTP by mouth does not help symptoms of Alzheimer disease. 
Anxiety. Evidence on the effects of 5-HTP for anxiety is unclear. Early research shows that taking 25-150 mg of 5-HTP by mouth daily along with carbidopa seems to reduce anxiety symptoms in people with anxiety disorders. However, other early research shows that taking higher doses of 5-HTP, 225 mg daily or more, seems to make anxiety worse. Also, taking 60 mg of 5-HTP daily through the vein does not reduce anxiety in people with panic disorders. 
Brain damage that affects muscle movement (cerebellar ataxia). Evidence on the use of 5-HTP for cerebellar ataxia is unclear. Early evidence shows that taking 5 mg/kg of 5-HTP daily for 4 months can decrease nervous system dysfunction. However, other research shows that taking 5-HTP daily for up to one year does not improve symptoms of cerebellar ataxia.

Taking lutein by mouth prevents lutein deficiency.Possibly effective for...An eye disease that leads to vision loss in older adults (age-related macular degeneration or AMD). People who eat higher amounts of lutein in their diet seem to have a lower risk of developing AMD. But people who already eat high amounts of lutein might not benefit from increasing their intake even more. Taking lutein supplements for up to 36 months can improve some symptoms of AMD. Greater improvement in symptoms might be seen when lutein is taken for at least 1 year at doses above 10 mg, and when it is combined with other carotenoid vitamins. Lutein does not seem to keep AMD from becoming worse over time.
Cataracts. Eating higher amounts of lutein is linked with a lower risk of developing cataracts. Taking supplements containing lutein and zeaxanthin reduces the risk of developing cataracts that require surgical removal in people who eat low amounts of lutein and zeaxanthin as part of their diet. Also, taking lutein supplements seems to improve vision in older people who already have cataracts and do not already consume a lot of lutein and zeaxanthin.
Cancer that starts in white blood cells (non-Hodgkin lymphoma). People who eat higher amounts of lutein in their diet or take lutein supplements might have a lower chance of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Heart disease. Some population evidence suggests that people who eat higher amounts of lutein or take lutein supplements have a lower risk of heart-related adverse events like a heart attack or stroke. However, high-quality research shows that taking lutein 10 mg with zeaxanthin 2 mg by mouth daily doesn't prevent death due to heart disease, stroke, heart attack, or chest pain in older people. 
Fractures. People who eat higher amounts of lutein in their diet don't have a lower risk of fractures.
Stomach cancer. People who eat higher amounts of lutein in their diet don't have a lower risk of developing stomach cancer. 
A serious intestinal disease in premature infants (necrotizing enterocolitis or NEC). Research shows that giving preterm infants lutein and zeaxanthin by mouth doesn't prevent necrotizing enterocolitis.
Pancreatic cancer. People who eat higher amounts of lutein in their diet don't have a lower risk of developing pancreatic cancer.

Diabetes. Some research suggests that low blood levels of lutein or other carotenoids are linked with blood sugar problems. In theory, taking lutein might reduce the risk of developing diabetes. However, other research suggests that increasing lutein intake in the diet doesn't reduce the risk of developing diabetes.

Cascara sagrada used to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an over-the-counter (OTC) drug for constipation. However, over the years, concerns were raised about cascara sagrada’s safety and effectiveness. The FDA gave manufacturers the chance to submit safety and effectiveness information to answer these concerns. But the companies decided the cost of conducting safety and effectiveness studies would likely be more than the profit they could expect from sales of cascara sagrada. So they didn’t comply with the request. As a result, the FDA notified manufacturers to remove or reformulate all OTC laxative products containing cascara sagrada from the U.S. market by November 5, 2002. Today, you can buy cascara sagrada as a “dietary supplement,” but not as a drug. “Dietary supplements” don’t have to meet the standards that the FDA applies to OTC or prescription drugs.

Cascara sagrada is commonly used by mouth as a laxative for constipation.

In foods and beverages, a bitterless extract of cascara sagrada is sometimes used as a flavoring agent.

The iodine needed by the body must come from the diet. As a rule, there is very little iodine in food, unless it has been added during processing. Processed food typically contains more iodine due to the addition of iodized salt. Most of the world's iodine is found in the ocean, where it is concentrated by sea life, especially seaweed.

The thyroid gland needs iodine to make hormones. If the thyroid doesn't have enough iodine to do its job, systems in the body cause the thyroid to work harder. This can cause an enlarged thyroid gland (goiter), which causes a swollen neck.

Other consequences of not having enough iodine (iodine deficiency) are also serious. Iodine deficiency and the resulting low levels of thyroid hormone can cause women to stop ovulating, leading to infertility. Iodine deficiency can also lead to an autoimmune disease of the thyroid and may increase the risk of getting thyroid cancer. Some researchers think that iodine deficiency might also increase the risk of other cancers such as prostate, breast, endometrial, and ovarian cancer.

Iodine deficiency during pregnancy is serious for both the mother and the baby. It can lead to high blood pressure during pregnancy for the mother and mental retardation for the baby. Iodine plays an important role in development of the central nervous system. In extreme cases, iodine deficiency can lead to cretinism, a disorder that involves severely stunted physical and mental growth.

Iodine deficiency is a common world health problem. The most recognized form of deficiency is goiter. Additionally, across the globe iodine deficiency is thought to be the most common preventable cause of mental retardation. Early in the twentieth century, iodine deficiency was common in the US and Canada, but the addition of iodine to salt has improved public health. The addition of iodine to salt is required in Canada. In the  US, iodized salt is not required, but it is widely available. Researchers estimate that iodized salt is used regularly by about half the US population.

Iodine is taken by mouth to prevent and treat iodine deficiency and its consequences, including goiter and some thyroid disorders. It is also used for treating lumpy breasts (fibrocystic breast disease) and breast pain (mastalgia).

Iodine is also used for radiation emergencies, to protect the thyroid gland against radioactive iodides. Potassium iodide tablets for use in a radiation emergency are available as FDA-approved products (ThyroShield, Iosat) and on the Internet as food supplements. Potassium iodide should only be used in a radiation emergency, not in advance of an emergency to prevent sickness.

Iodine is sometimes applied to the skin for skin inflammation and to kill germs and facilitate wound healing. It is also used prevent soreness inside the mouth or along the digestive tract, and other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.

Most iodine supplements contain potassium. Taking potassium iodide along with some medications for high blood pressure might cause too much potassium in the body. Do not take potassium iodide if you are taking medications for high blood pressure.

The ARBs include losartan (Cozaar), valsartan (Diovan), irbesartan (Avapro), candesartan (Atacand), telmisartan (Micardis), and eprosartan (Teveten).Water pills (Potassium-sparing diuretics)Most iodine supplements contain potassium. Some ""water pills"" might also increase potassium in the body. Taking potassium iodide along with some ""water pills"" might cause too much potassium to be in the body. Do not take potassium iodide if you are taking ""water pills"" that increase potassium in the body.

Some ""water pills"" that increase potassium in the body include spironolactone (Aldactone), triamterene (Dyrenium), and amiloride (Midamor).",interactions with medications,Iodine,Are there interactions between Iodine and other medications ?,Drugs

ADULTS
BY MOUTH: 

For iodine deficiency: Consumption of iodized salt is recommended in most cases.
For most people, iodized salt containing 20-40 mg of iodine per kilogram of salt is recommended. If salt consumption is less than 10 grams per person per day, the amount of iodine in salt may need to be higher.
In pregnant and lactating women, iodine supplements providing 250 mcg of iodine daily or a single annual dose of 400 mg of iodized oil are recommended.
For radiation exposure: Potassium iodide (KI) should be taken just prior to, or as soon as possible after, exposure. Radiation is most harmful to pregnant or breastfeeding women and children, so KI is dosed according to amount of radiation exposure and age. Radiation exposure is measured in centigrays (cGy). For pregnant or breastfeeding women, KI is given if radiation exposure is 5 centigrays (cGy) or more.

For pregnant or breastfeeding women, 120 mg.
For adults 18 to 40 years with exposure to 10 cGy or more, 130 mg of KI is given.
For adults over 40 years with exposure to 500 cGy or more, 130 mg of KI is given.
For thyroid storm: Five drops of a saturated solution of potassium iodine every 6 hours is recommended.
For reducing the size of thyroid nodules: Iodized salt 150-200 mcg daily in addition to thyroxine 1.5 mcg per kg daily after surgery for benign nodular thyroid disease, or 50-100 mcg/day based on needs, for up to 12 months.
For a type of benign (non-cancerous) breast disease (fibrocystic breast disease): Molecular iodine 70-90 mcg/kg for 4-18 months.
For breast pain (mastalgia): Iodine 3000-6000 mcg daily for 5 months.
ON THE SKIN:

For leg sores caused by weak blood circulation (venous leg ulcer): Topical application of cadexomer iodine to venous leg ulcers for 4-6 weeks. Also, solutions containing 10% povidone-iodine, ointment containing 10% povidone-iodine, and dry powder spray containing 2.5% povidone-iodine have been used in combination with compression therapy.
For foot sores in people with diabetes: Topical iodine 0.9% ointment for 12 weeks.
For swelling (inflammation) and sores inside the mouth (oral mucositis): 100 mL of a mouth rinse containing povidone-iodine solution used as a rinse for 3 minutes four times daily starting at the beginning of radiotherapy and continuing until one week after radiation is completed.
For a serious gum infection (periodontitis): A rinse with 0.1% to 10% povidone-iodine used during scaling and root planing.
For infection after surgery: Spray containing iodine in the form of povidone-iodine has been applied before and after wound closure. Also, solution containing 0.35% to 10% povidone-iodine has been applied for one to three minutes before or after wound closure.
Swelling (inflammation) of the lining of the uterus (endometritis): A vaginal wash containing iodine in the form of povidone-iodine 1% to 10% has been used immediately before Cesarean delivery.
CHILDREN
BY MOUTH: 

For iodine deficiency: Consumption of iodized salt is recommended in most cases.
For most people, iodized salt containing 20-40 mg of iodine per kilogram of salt is recommended. If salt consumption is less than 10 grams per person per day, the amount of iodine in salt may need to be higher.
In children aged 7 months to 2 years, iodine supplementation may be necessary if iodized salt is not available. In those cases, supplements providing 90 mcg of iodine daily or a single annual dose of 200 mg of iodized oil is recommended.
For radiation exposure: Potassium iodide (KI) should be taken just prior to, or as soon as possible after, exposure. Radiation is most harmful to pregnant or breastfeeding women and children, so KI is dosed according to amount of radiation exposure and age. Radiation exposure is measured in centigrays (cGy). For infants, babies, children, and adolescents, KI is given if radiation exposure is 5 centigrays (cGy) or more.
For birth through 1 month, the dose is 16 mg of KI.
For babies and children over 1 month through 3 years, 32 mg.
For children 3 to 12 years, 65 mg.
For adolescents 12 through 18 years, 65 mg or 120 mg if the adolescent is approaching adult size. 

AS EYE DROPS:

Pink eye: Eye drops containing 2.5% povidone-iodine given shortly after birth.

The National Academy of Medicine has set Adequate Intake (AI) of iodine for infants: 0 to 6 months, 110 mcg/day; 7 to 12 months, 130 mcg/day.

For children and adults, Recommended Dietary Amounts (RDA) have been set: children 1 to 8 years, 90 mcg/day; 9 to 13 years, 120 mcg/day; people age 14 and older, 150 mcg/day. For pregnant women, the RDA is 220 mcg/day, and breastfeeding women, 290 mcg/day.

Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (UL), the highest level of intake that is not likely to cause unwanted side effects, for iodine intake have been set: children 1 to 3 years, 200 mcg/day; 4 to 8 years, 300 mcg/day; 9 to 13 years, 600 mcg/day; 14 to 18 years (including pregnancy and breastfeeding), 900 mcg/day. For adults older than age 19 including pregnant and breastfeeding women, the Tolerable Upper Intake Level is 1100 mcg/day.

Thinning of vaginal tissue (vaginal atrophy). The walls of the vagina can become thinner after menopause. This can cause pain during sex. Using vaginal inserts containing DHEA can reduce pain during sex by up to 15% in women after menopause. A prescription DHEA product is available for this condition. 
Possibly effective for...
Aging skin. Some research shows that taking DHEA by mouth or applying it to the skin might improve skin appearance in women after menopause and in people over the age of 60 years.  
Depression. Some research shows that taking 30-500 mg of DHEA by mouth daily improves symptoms of depression. Lower doses do not seem to help. Some experts recommend DHEA for depression if more common medications don't work. 
Inability to become pregnant within a year of trying to conceive (infertility). Most research shows that taking DHEA for 2 to 3 months before in-vitro fertilization (IVF) might improve the chances of pregnancy and having a baby. However, other research shows that taking DHEA does not seem to prevent miscarriage in women that have had IVF. It isn't known if taking DHEA helps women get pregnant without IVF. 

Possibly ineffective for...
Aging. Taking DHEA daily for up to 2 years does not seem to improve body shape, bone strength, muscle strength, or quality of life in people older than 60 who have low DHEA levels. 
Muscle strength. Most research shows that DHEA does not improve muscle strength in adults. 
Physical performance in elderly adults. Most research shows that DHEA does not improve physical performance in older adults. But it might help frail elderly women. 
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Early research suggests that taking DHEA does not reduce symptoms of RA in older people.  

Likely ineffective for...
Memory and thinking skills (cognitive function). Most research shows that taking DHEA by mouth does not seem to improve mental function or decrease mental decline in healthy older people, people with HIV, or in healthy young adults.
An autoimmune disorder in which the glands that produce tears and saliva are damaged (Sjogren syndrome). Research shows that taking DHEA does not improve symptoms of a condition called Sjögren syndrome that causes dry eyes and dry mouth.
Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
An inherited disorder in which the adrenal glands do not make enough hormones (Addison disease). The effects of DHEA on the symptoms of Addison disease are not clear. Some early research shows that taking DHEA might improve symptoms such as weight loss and bone density loss. Other research shows that taking DHEA does not improve most symptoms. But it might improve mood and feelings of tiredness. 
A disorder in which the adrenal glands do not make enough hormones (adrenal insufficiency). The effects of DHEA in women who have symptoms related to a lack of adrenal hormone is not clear. Some research shows that DHEA might improve feelings of well-being and sexuality. Other research shows that DHEA provides no benefit. 
Athletic performance. Early research shows that taking DHEA does not improve sprint performance in female athletes. 
Improving growth and maturation in girls with hormone deficiency (atrichia pubis). Some early reports suggest that DHEA might help growth and maturation in girls with atrichia pubis.
Heart disease. It isn't known if taking DHEA can help prevent or treat heart disease. But people with heart disease and low levels of DHEA in the body seem to be at higher risk for things like a heart attack.

Fibromyalgia. Early research shows that taking DHEA does not reduce symptoms of fibromyalgia. 
HIV/AIDS. Early studies show that taking DHEA might improve mood and quality of life in people with HIV. 
Symptoms of menopause. Early research shows that taking DHEA might reduce hot flashes in postmenopausal women. Some research shows that using DHEA in the vagina might improve sexual function.
A grouping of symptoms that increase the risk of diabetes, heart disease, and stroke (metabolic syndrome). There is early evidence that DHEA might lower some of the health risks that put overweight men and women at risk for heart disease and diabetes. Taking DHEA might decrease weight, fat around the waist, and insulin levels. 
A group of inherited disorders that cause muscle weakness and muscle loss (muscular dystrophy).

This chemical can be made in the laboratory into various steroids, such as estrogen and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). The root and the bulb of the plant are used as a source of diosgenin, which is prepared as an “extract,” a liquid that contains concentrated diosgenin.

There are over 600 species of wild yam. Some species are grown specifically as a source of diosgenin for laboratories to use in making steroids. These species are generally not eaten due to a bitter flavor. Only about 12 of the 600 species are considered edible.

Diosgenin or wild yam is often promoted as a “natural alterative” to estrogen therapy, so you will see it used for estrogen replacement therapy, vaginal dryness in older women, PMS (premenstrual syndrome), menstrual cramps, weak bones (osteoporosis), increasing energy and sexual drive in men and women, and breast enlargement. Wild yam does seem to have some estrogen-like activity, but it is not actually converted into estrogen in the body. It takes a laboratory to do that.

Similarly, you will also see wild yam and diosgenin promoted as a “natural DHEA.” This is because in the laboratory DHEA is made from diosgenin, but this chemical reaction is not believed to occur in the human body. So taking wild yam extract will not increase DHEA levels in people. Individuals who are interested in taking DHEA should avoid wild yam products labeled as ""natural DHEA.""

Homeopathy is a system of medicine established in the 19th century by a German physician named Samuel Hahnemann. Its basic principles are that ""like treats like"" and ""potentiation through dilution."" For example, in homeopathy, influenza would be treated with an extreme dilution of a substance that normally causes influenza when taken in high doses.
A French physician discovered oscillococcinum while investigating the Spanish flu in 1917. But he was mistaken that his ""oscillococci"" were the cause of the flu.

Practitioners of homeopathy believe that more dilute preparations are more potent. Many homeopathic preparations are so diluted that they contain little or no active ingredient. Therefore, most homeopathic products are not expected to act like drugs, or have drug interactions or other harmful effects. Any beneficial effects are controversial and cannot be explained by current scientific methods.

Dilutions of 1 to 10 are designated by an ""X."" So a 1X dilution = 1:10 or 1 part of an active ingredient in 10 parts of water; 3X = 1:1000; 6X = 1:1,000,000.

The Canadian government, however, is concerned enough about the safety of arnica to prohibit its use as a food ingredient.

Amounts that are larger than the amount found in food are LIKELY UNSAFE when taken by mouth. In fact, arnica is considered poisonous and has caused death. When taken by mouth it can also cause irritation of the mouth and throat, stomach pain, vomiting, diarrhea, skin rashes, shortness of breath, a fast heartbeat, an increase in blood pressure, heart damage, organ failure, increased bleeding, coma, and death.

Arnica is often listed as an ingredient in homeopathic products; however, these products are usually so dilute that they contain little or no detectable amount of arnica.

Canker sores. Research shows that applying a gel containing berberine can reduce pain, redness, oozing, and the size of ulcers in people with canker sores. 
Diabetes. Berberine seems to slightly reduce blood sugar levels in people with diabetes. Also, some early research suggests that taking 500 mg of berberine 2-3 times daily for up to 3 months might control blood sugar as effectively as metformin or rosiglitazone.
High levels of cholesterol or other fats (lipids) in the blood (hyperlipidemia). Berberine might help lower cholesterol levels in people with high cholesterol. Taking berberine for up to 2 years seems to reduce total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL or ""bad"") cholesterol, and triglyceride levels in people with high cholesterol. When compared with standard cholesterol-lowering medications, berberine appears to cause similar changes in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL or ""good"") cholesterol, and it might be better at reducing triglyceride levels. 
High blood pressure. Taking 0.9 grams of berberine per day along with the blood pressure-lowering drug amlodipine reduces systolic blood pressure (the top number) and diastolic blood pressure (the bottom number) better than taking amlodipine alone in people with high blood pressure.
A hormonal disorder that causes enlarged ovaries with cysts (polycystic ovary syndrome or PCOS). Research shows that berberine can lower blood sugar, improve cholesterol and triglyceride levels, reduce testosterone levels, and lower waist-to-hip ratio in women with PCOS. Berberine may even lower blood sugar levels similar to metformin and may improve cholesterol levels better than metformin. It is unclear if berberine increases pregnancy rates or live birth rates in women with PCOS. Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Burns. Early research suggests that applying an ointment that contains berberine and beta-sitosterol can treat second-degree burns as effectively as conventional treatment with silver sulfadiazine.
An infection of the intestines that causes diarrhea (cholera). Some early research suggests that taking berberine sulfate can decrease diarrhea by a small amount in people with cholera. However, berberine does not seem to improve the effects of the antibiotic tetracycline in treating diarrhea related to cholera infection.
Heart failure and fluid build up in the body (congestive heart failure or CHF). Early research suggests that berberine can reduce some of the symptoms and lower the death rate in some people with congestive heart failure.
Heart disease. Research shows that taking a specific product containing berberine and other ingredients for 3 months lowers cholesterol levels in people with heart disease who had a procedure called a percutaneous intervention (PCI). This product seems to lower cholesterol levels more than the standard medication ezetimibe, which is used to lower cholesterol. Also taking this product in combination with low doses of medicines called ""statins"" seems to work better than taking low-dose statins alone. It's unclear if the effects of this product are due to berberine, other ingredients, or the combination. It's also unknown whether this product reduces the risk of major adverse heart-related events in people with heart disease.
Diarrhea. Some early research suggests that taking berberine sulfate can decrease diarrhea in people with an E. coli infection. 
A group of eye disorders that can lead to vision loss (glaucoma). Early research suggests that using eye drops containing berberine and tetrahydrozoline for does not reduce eye pressure in people with glaucoma better than eye drops containing tetrahydrozoline alone.
A digestive tract infection that can lead to ulcers (Helicobacter pylori or H. pylori). Early research suggests that taking berberine is more effective than the drug ranitidine at treating H. pylori infection. But berberine seems less effective at healing ulcers in people with stomach ulcers due to H. pylori. Other research shows that berberine might treat H. pylori infection as well as the medication bismuth when taken in combination with a standard three-drug regimen for H. pylori infection. 
Swelling (inflammation) of the liver caused by the hepatitis B virus (hepatitis B). Early research suggests that berberine decreases blood sugar, blood fats called triglycerides, and markers of liver damage in people with diabetes and hepatitis B.
Swelling (inflammation) of the liver caused by the hepatitis C virus (hepatitis C). Early research suggests that berberine decreases blood sugar, blood fats called triglycerides, and markers of liver damage in people with diabetes and hepatitis C.
A long-term disorder of the large intestines that causes stomach pain (irritable bowel syndrome or IBS). Early research shows taking that berberine twice daily for 8 weeks might reduce diarrhea and stomach pain and might improve quality of life in people with IBS with diarrhea. 
Symptoms of menopause. Early research suggests that taking a combination of berberine and soy isoflavones can reduce menopausal symptoms. However, it's not clear if berberine reduces menopausal symptoms if used alone.
A grouping of symptoms that increase the risk of diabetes, heart disease, and stroke (metabolic syndrome). Early research suggests that berberine reduces body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure (the top number), blood fats called triglycerides, and blood sugar levels in people with metabolic syndrome. It also seems to improve insulin sensitivity. Other early research suggests that taking a combination product containing berberine, policosanol, red yeast rice, folic acid, coenzyme Q10, and astaxanthin improves blood pressure and blood flow in people with metabolic syndrome.
Build up of fat in the liver in people who drink little or no alcohol (nonalcoholic fatty liver disease or NAFLD). Early research suggests that berberine reduces fat in the blood and markers of liver injury in people with diabetes and liver disease not caused by alcohol. Other early research shows that berberine might reduce fat on the liver, markers of liver injury, and weight in people with this condition. Berberine seems to work about as well as the medication pioglitazone. 
Obesity. Early research suggests that taking berberine can reduce weight in obese people by about 5 pounds.
Weak and brittle bones (osteoporosis). Early research suggests that taking berberine together with vitamin D3, vitamin K, and a chemical found in hops can decrease bone loss in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Its not known if berberine is beneficial if taken by itself.
Diarrhea caused by radiation therapy. Some early research suggests that taking berberine during radiation therapy can reduce intestinal injury from radiation in patients being treated for cancer.
Scarring of tissue caused by radiation therapy. Some early research suggests that taking berberine during radiation therapy can reduce lung injury from radiation in patients being treated for cancer.
Low levels of platelets in the blood (thrombocytopenia). Blood platelets are important for blood clotting. Early research suggests that taking berberine either alone or with prednisolone, can increase the number of blood platelets in people with low blood platelet counts.
An eye infection caused by Chlamydia trachomatis (trachoma). There is some evidence that eye drops containing berberine might be useful for treating trachoma, a common cause of blindness in developing countries.

It is found in foods such as yeast, meat, fish, milk, eggs, green vegetables, and cereal grains. Niacin is also produced in the body from tryptophan, which is found in protein-containing food. When taken as a supplement, niacin is often found in combination with other B vitamins. 

Do not confuse niacin with niacinamide, inositol nicotinate, IP-6, or tryptophan. See the separate listings for these topics. 

Niacin is commonly taken by mouth for high cholesterol and to increase levels of a specific type of good cholesterol, known as HDL. Niacin is also taken by mouth for preventing vitamin B3 deficiency and related conditions such as pellagra. It is also taken by mouth for metabolic syndrome and diarrhea caused by cholera infection.

Abnormal levels of blood fats. Some niacin products are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as prescription products for treating abnormal levels of blood fats. These prescription niacin products typically come in high strengths of 500 mg or higher. Dietary supplement forms of niacin usually come in strengths of 250 mg or less. Since very high doses of niacin are required for improving cholesterol levels, dietary supplement niacin usually isn't appropriate. For people who need to lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL or ""bad"") cholesterol, the prescription drug class called ""statins"" is used. Niacin might be used in people with high levels of both cholesterol AND blood fats called triglycerides. Niacin may be combined with other cholesterol-lowering drugs when diet and single-drug therapy is not enough. Niacin improves cholesterol levels, but does not improve cardiovascular outcomes such as heart attacks and strokes. 
Treatment and prevention of niacin deficiency, and certain conditions related to niacin deficiency such as pellagra. Niacin is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for these uses. However, using niacinamide instead of niacin is sometimes preferred because niacinamide doesn't cause ""flushing,"" (redness, itching and tingling), a side effect of niacin treatment.

Possibly effective for...
Diarrhea from an infection called cholera. Taking niacin by mouth seems to control the loss of fluid due to cholera.
Abnormal levels of blood fats in people with HIV/AIDS. Taking niacin seems to improve levels of cholesterol and blood fats called triglycerides in HIV/AIDS patients with abnormal blood fat levels due to antiretroviral treatment.
Metabolic syndrome. Taking niacin seems to increase levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL or ""good"") cholesterol and reduce levels of blood fats called triglycerides in people with metabolic syndrome. Taking the niacin along with a prescription omega-3 fatty acid seems to work even better.
Ineffective for...
Cardiovascular disease. High quality research shows that niacin does not prevent cardiovascular events such as a heart attack or stroke or death related to cardiovascular disease in people who take niacin to prevent or treat cardiovascular disease. Niacin has not been shown to reduce the risk of death. Niacin improves cholesterol levels, but it does not improve outcomes related to cardiovascular disease. Niacin should not be taken to treat or prevent cardiovascular disease.

Hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis). Taking niacin by mouth along with medicines called bile acid sequestrants might reduce hardening of the arteries in men with this condition. It seems to work best in men with high levels of blood fats called triglycerides. But taking niacin does not seem to reduce hardening of the arteries in patients with a condition called peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Also, niacin does not prevent cardiovascular events such as a heart attack or stroke.
Alzheimer's disease. People who consume higher amounts of niacin from food and multivitamins seem to have a lower risk of getting Alzheimer's disease than people who consume less niacin. But there is no evidence that taking a stand-alone niacin supplement helps to prevent Alzheimer's disease.
Cataracts. People who eat a diet high in niacin might have a reduced chance of developing nuclear cataracts. Nuclear cataract is the most common type of cataract. The effect of taking niacin supplementation is unknown.
Erectile dysfunction. Taking extended-release niacin 1.5 grams at bedtime for 12 weeks seems to help men with erectile dysfunction and high lipid levels maintain an erection during sexual intercourse.
Exercise performance. Research shows that taking a supplement containing niacin and other ingredients before exercise does not improve performance during exercise in men.
High levels of phosphate in the blood (hyperphosphatemia). High blood levels of phosphate can result from kidney dysfunction. Some early research shows that taking niacin by mouth can reduce blood levels of phosphate in people with end-stage kidney disease and high levels of blood phosphate. But other research shows that taking niacin by mouth at a higher dose does not lower blood phosphate levels when taken along with medication used to lower blood phosphate levels.

MPlusHerbsSupplements,https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/924.html,"Niacin is LIKELY SAFE for most people when taken by mouth. A common minor side effect of niacin is a flushing reaction. This might cause burning, tingling, itching, and redness of the face, arms, and chest, as well as headaches. Starting with small doses of niacin and taking 325 mg of aspirin before each dose of niacin will help reduce the flushing reaction. Usually, this reaction goes away as the body gets used to the medication. Alcohol can make the flushing reaction worse. Avoid large amounts of alcohol while taking niacin.

Other minor side effects of niacin are stomach upset, intestinal gas, dizziness, pain in the mouth, and other problems.

When doses of over 3 grams per day of niacin are taken, more serious side effects can happen. These include liver problems, gout, ulcers of the digestive tract, loss of vision, high blood sugar, irregular heartbeat, and other serious problems.

When used daily for multiple years, niacin might increase the risk of developing diabetes.

Some concern has been raised about stroke risk in people taking niacin. In one large study, people who took high doses of niacin had a two-fold greater risk of stroke compared to those not taking niacin. However, it is unlikely that this outcome was due to niacin. Other research has shown that niacin has no effect on the risk of stroke. 
Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Niacin is LIKELY SAFE for pregnant and breast-feeding women when taken in the recommended amounts. The recommended amount of niacin for pregnant or breast-feeding women is 30 mg per day for women under 18 years of age, and 35 mg for women over 18.
Allergies: Niacin might worsen allergies by causing histamine, the chemical responsible for allergic symptoms, to be released.
Heart disease/unstable angina: Large amounts of niacin can increase the risk of irregular heartbeat. Use with caution.
Crohn's disease: People with Crohn's disease might have low niacin levels and require supplementation during flare-ups.
Diabetes: Niacin might increase blood sugar. People with diabetes who take niacin should check their blood sugar carefully.

Heart disease. Oat bran contains high amounts of fiber. Foods high in fiber can be used as part of a diet low in fat and cholesterol to prevent heart disease. In fact, food products containing whole oats that provide 750 mg of soluble fiber per serving can be labeled with the health claim that the product may reduce the risk of heart disease when included as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol.
Lowering cholesterol. Eating oats, oat bran, and other soluble fibers can modestly reduce total and ""bad"" low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol when consumed as part of a diet low in saturated fat. For each gram of soluble fiber (beta-glucan) consumed, total cholesterol decreases by about 1.42 mg/dL and LDL by about 1.23 mg/dL. Eating 3-10 grams of soluble fiber can reduce total cholesterol by about 4-14 mg/dL. But there's a limit. Doses of soluble fiber greater than 10 grams per day don't seem to increase effectiveness.

Eating three bowls of oatmeal (28 gram servings) daily can decrease total cholesterol by about 5 mg/dL. Oat bran products (oat bran muffins, oat bran flakes, oat bran Os, etc.) may vary in their ability to lower cholesterol, depending on the total soluble fiber content. Whole oat products might be more effective in lowering LDL and total cholesterol than foods containing oat bran plus beta-glucan soluble fiber.

The FDA recommends that approximately 3 grams of soluble fiber be taken daily to lower blood cholesterol levels. However, this recommendation doesn't match research findings; according to controlled clinical studies, at least 3.6 grams of soluble fiber daily is needed to lower cholesterol.

Long-term, eating 100 grams of oats in place of other carbohydrates has the most long-lasting effect on blood glucose. Furthermore, there is some evidence that consuming 50 grams of oat bran daily, which contains 25 grams of soluble fiber, might be more effective than the standard moderate fiber diet of 24 grams daily recommended by the American Diabetes Association.
Stomach cancer. People who eat high-fiber foods, such as oats and oat bran, seem to have a lower risk of stomach cancer.

Do not confuse phosphate salts with substances such as organophosphates, or with tribasic sodium phosphates and tribasic potassium phosphates, which are very poisonous.

Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Phosphate salts from dietary sources are LIKELY SAFE for pregnant or breast-feeding women when used at the recommended allowances of 1250 mg daily for mothers between 14-18 years of age and 700 mg daily for those over 18 years of age. Other amounts are POSSIBLY UNSAFE and should only be used with the advice and ongoing care of a healthcare professional.
Children: Phosphate salts are LIKELY SAFE for children when used at the recommended daily allowances of 460 mg for children 1-3 years of age; 500 mg for children 4-8 years of age; and 1250 mg for children 9-18 years of age. Phosphate salts are  POSSIBLY UNSAFE if the amount of phosphate consumed (expressed as phosphorous) exceeds the tolerable upper intake level (UL). The ULs are 3 grams per day for children 1-8 years; and 4 grams per day for children 9 years and older.
Heart disease: Avoid using phosphate salts that contain sodium if you have heart disease.
Fluid retention (edema): Avoid using phosphate salts that contain sodium if you have cirrhosis, heart failure, or other conditions that can cause edema.
High levels of calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia): Use phosphate salts cautiously if you have hypercalcemia. Too much phosphate could cause calcium to be deposited where it shouldn't be in your body.
High levels of phosphate in the blood: People with Addison's disease, severe heart and lung disease, kidney disease, thyroid problems, or liver disease are more likely than other people to develop too much phosphate in their blood when they take phosphate salts. Use phosphate salts only with the advice and ongoing care of a healthcare professional if you have one of these conditions.
Kidney disease: Use phosphate salts only with the advice and ongoing care of a healthcare professional if you have kidney problems.",precautions,Phosphate salts,Are there safety concerns or special precautions about Phosphate salts ?,Drugs

People who replace saturated fats in their diet with olive oil also seem to have a lower blood pressure and lower cholesterol compared to those who consume more saturated fat in their diet. High cholesterol and high blood pressure are risk factors for heart disease. Research also shows that following a diet that includes olive oil also reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke, and heart disease-related death compared to following the same diet that includes less olive oil. The FDA allows labels on olive oil and on food that contains olive oil to state that limited, but not conclusive evidence, suggests that consuming 23 grams/day (about 2 tablespoons) of olive oil instead of saturated fats may reduce the risk of heart disease. The FDA also allows products containing certain forms of olive oil to claim that consuming these products can reduce the risk of heart disease. It's unclear if higher dietary intake of olive oil is beneficial in people who already have heart disease. Results from research are conflicting. 
Constipation. Taking olive oil by mouth can help to soften stools in people with constipation.
Diabetes. People who eat higher amounts of olive oil (about 15-20 grams per day) seem to have a lower risk of developing diabetes. Eating more than 20 grams per day is not linked with additional benefit. Research also shows that olive oil can improve blood sugar control in people with diabetes. Olive oil in a Mediterranean-type diet might also reduce the risk of ""hardening of the arteries"" (atherosclerosis) compared to polyunsaturated oils such as sunflower oil in people with diabetes.
High cholesterol. Using olive oil in the diet instead of saturated fat may reduce total cholesterol levels in people with high cholesterol. But other dietary oils might reduce total cholesterol better than olive oil.
High blood pressure. Adding generous amounts of extra virgin olive oil to the diet and continuing with the usual treatments for high blood pressure can improve blood pressure over 6 months in people with high blood pressure. In some cases, people with mild to moderate high blood pressure can actually lower their dose of blood pressure medication or even stop taking medication altogether. However, do not adjust your medications without your healthcare provider's supervision. Taking olive leaf extract also seems to lower blood pressure in patients with high blood pressure.
Possibly ineffective for...Earwax. Applying olive oil to the skin does not appear to soften earwax.
Ear infection (otitis media). Applying olive oil to the skin does not appear to reduce pain in children with ear infections.Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Eczema (atopic dermatitis). Early research suggests that applying a mixture of honey, beeswax, and olive oil along with standard care seems to improve eczema.
Cancer. People who eat more olive oil seem to have a lower risk of developing cancer. But dietary intake of olive oil is not linked with a lower risk of cancer-related death.
Leakage of a body fluid (chyle) into the space between the lungs and chest wall. Sometimes chyle leaks into the space between the lungs and chest wall during surgery of the esophagus. Taking about half a cup of olive oil eight hours before surgery might help prevent this injury.  
Memory and thinking skills (cognitive function). Middle-aged women who use olive oil for cooking seem to have improved thinking skills compared to those who use other cooking oils.  
Colon cancer, rectal cancer. Research suggests that people who consume more olive oil in their diet might have a lower risk of developing colorectal cancer.
Airway infections caused by exerciser. Early research shows that taking olive leaf extract doesn't prevent the common cold in student athletes. But it might help female athletes use fewer sick days. 
A digestive tract infection that can lead to ulcers (Helicobacter pylori or H. pylori). Early research shows that taking 30 grams of olive oil before breakfast for 2-4 weeks helps get rid of Helicobacter pylori infections in some people.  
A grouping of symptoms that increase the risk of diabetes, heart disease, and stroke (metabolic syndrome). Metabolic syndrome is a group of conditions such as high blood pressure, excess body fat around the waist, or high blood sugar that can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, or diabetes. Taking olive leaf extract seems to help control of blood sugar in men with this condition. But it does not seem to reduce body weight, cholesterol levels, or blood pressure. 
Migraine. Taking olive oil daily for 2 months seems to reduce the frequency and severity of migraine headaches. However, more research is needed.
Build up of fat in the liver in people who drink little or no alcohol (nonalcoholic fatty liver disease or NAFLD). Taking olive oil as part of a low-calorie diet may improve fatty liver better than dieting alone in patients with NAFLD.   
Obesity. Taking olive oil daily for 9 weeks as part of a low-calorie diet seems to help with fat loss, but not overall weight loss.  
Osteoarthritis. Developing research shows that taking a freeze-dried water extract of olive fruit or an extract of olive leaf decreases pain and increases mobility in people with osteoarthritis.
Weak and brittle bones (osteoporosis). Taking olive leaf extract daily along with calcium might slow down bone loss in postmenopausal women with low bone density.
Ovarian cancer. Research suggests that women who consume more olive oil in their diet have a lower risk of developing ovarian cancer.
A serious gum infection (periodontitis). Using ozonated olive oil in the mouth, alone or following mouth treatment such as teeth scaling and root planing, seems to reduce the build-up of plaque and prevent bleeding and inflammation of the gums.
Scaly, itchy skin (psoriasis). Early research suggests that applying a mixture of honey, beeswax, and olive oil to the skin along with standard care can improve psoriasis.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Some research suggests that people whose diet includes a high amount of olive oil have a lower risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis. However, early research shows that taking a water extract of olive fruit does not significantly improve symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis.
Stretch marks. Early research shows that applying a small amount of olive oil to the stomach twice daily starting early in the second semester does not prevent stretch marks during pregnancy.
Stroke. Eating a diet high in olive oil might reduce the chance of having a stroke compared to a similar diet with less olive oil.  
Ringworm (Tinea corporis). Early research suggests that applying a mixture of honey, beeswax, and olive oil to the skin is beneficial for treating ringworm.
Jock itch (Tinea cruris). Early research suggests that applying a mixture of honey, beeswax, and olive oil to the skin is beneficial for treating jock itch.
A common fungal infection of the skin (Tinea versicolor). Early research suggests that applying a mixture of honey, beeswax, and olive oil to the skin is beneficial for treating yeast infection.

Nerve pain in people with diabetes (diabetic neuropathy). Some research shows that applying a cream or using a skin patch containing capsaicin, the active chemical found in capsicum, reduces pain in people with diabetic neuropathy. A specific cream containing 0.075% capsaicin (Zostrix-HP, Link Medical Products Pty Ltd.) used 4 times daily is approved for treating this condition. Another patch containing 8% capsaicin (Qutenza, NeurogesX, Inc.), which is available by prescription only, has also been studied. But this patch is not approved for treating this type of nerve pain. Creams or gels that contain less capsaicin than 0.075% don't seem to work. Lotion used less frequently than 4 times daily also might not work. 
Pain. Applying creams and lotions containing capsaicin, the active chemical in capsicum, can temporarily relieve chronic pain from several conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, back pain, jaw pain, psoriasis, and other conditions.
Nerve damage caused by shingles (postherpetic neuralgia). Applying a patch containing 8% capsaicin (Qutenza, NeurogesX Inc.), the active chemical in capsicum reduces pain over 24 hours by 27% to 37% in people with nerve damage caused by shingles. This capsaicin patch is available by prescription only and must be applied by a health care provider.

Possibly effective for...
Back pain. Some research shows that applying a plaster that contains capsicum to the back can reduce low back pain.
Cluster headache. Some research shows that applying capsaicin, the active chemical in capsicum, inside the nose reduces the number and severity of cluster headaches. It's best to apply capsicum to the nostril that is on the same side of the head as the headache.
Osteoarthritis. Some research shows that applying capsaicin 0.025%, the active chemical in capsicum, to the skin can improve symptoms of osteoarthritis.  
Runny nose not caused by allergies or infection (perennial rhinitis). Research shows that applying capsaicin, the active chemical in capsicum, inside the nose can reduce runny nose in people without allergies or an infection. The benefits might last for 6-9 months.
Nausea and vomiting after surgery. Research shows that applying a plaster containing capsicum to specific points on the hand and forearm 30 minutes before anesthesia and leaving it in place for 6-8 hour daily for up to 3 days after surgery reduces nausea and vomiting after surgery.
Pain after surgery. Research shows that applying a plaster containing capsicum to specific points on the hand and forearm 30 minutes before anesthesia and leaving it in place for 6-8 hour daily for up to 3 days after surgery reduces the need for painkillers within the first 24 hours after surgery. Other research shows that applying a specific patch containing 8% capsaicin (Qutenza, NeurogesX, Inc.) one time can reduce pain for up to 12 weeks. However, it is not clear if this is due to a placebo effect. This product is available by prescription only.

Insufficient evidence to rate effectiveness for...
Athletic performance. Limited research shows that taking capsaicin before an athletic test might improve speed, strength and endurance by a small amount.
Hay fever. Early research suggests that inserting cotton wads in the nose that have been soaked in the capsicum active chemical capsaicin for 15 minutes and repeated over two days might reduce hay fever symptoms. But there is conflicting evidence that this might not improve symptoms. 
Burning pain in the mouth. Early research shows that using a mouth rinse containing capsaicin, the active chemical in capsicum, daily for 7 days slightly decreases burning discomfort in people with burning mouth syndrome. Other early research shows that applying a gel to the tongue three times daily for 14 days might slightly decrease pain in people with burning mouth syndrome. 
Diabetes. Early research shows that taking capsicum daily for 1 month can lower blood sugar levels after eating in pregnant women with gestational diabetes. But taking capsicum does not lower fasting blood sugar levels.
Indigestion (dyspepsia). Early research suggests that red pepper powder (containing capsicum) in capsules taken 3 times daily before meals reduces symptoms of heartburn. But in some people, symptoms get worse before they get better.
Fibromyalgia. Applying a cream containing 0.025% to 0.075% capsaicin, the active chemical in capsicum, 4 times daily to tender points might reduce tenderness in people with fibromyalgia. However, it doesn't seem to reduce overall pain or improve physical function.
Nerve damage in the hands and feet of people with HIV/AIDS. Some research suggest that applying a patch containing 8% capsaicin, the active chemical in capsicum, to the skin for 30-90 minutes reduce pain for up to 12 weeks in people with nerve damage caused by HIV. But other research suggests it might not provide any benefits. Applying cream containing 0.075% capsaicin does not seem to work.
A long-term disorder of the large intestines that causes stomach pain (irritable bowel syndrome or IBS). Early research shows that capsicum fruit taken by mouth does not help symptoms of IBS.
Joint pain. Early research shows that taking capsules of a specific combination product containing capsaicin, the active ingredient in capsicum, and many other ingredients (Instaflex Joint Support) daily for 8 weeks reduces joint pain by about 21% compared to placebo. The effects of capsicum alone cannot be determined from this study. 
Migraine. Some reports suggest that using the active chemical in capsicum in the nose might help migraine headaches.
Morton's neuroma. Some research shows that injecting capsicum into the foot one time might slightly reduce pain and decrease how much that pain interferes with walking and a person's mood. But capsicum only relieves pain in the first and fourth week after injection. 
A condition that causes persistent muscle pain (myofascial pain syndrome). Early research shows that using a specific cream (Dipental Cream) that contains capsaicin, an active chemical in capsicum, in addition to a ketoprofen patch does not further relieve pain in people with muscular pain in the upper back.
Obesity. Some research shows that taking capsules containing capsicum twice daily 30 minutes before eating for 12 weeks reduces stomach fat but not weight in overweight and obese people. But other research shows that taking a combination supplement containing capsicum extract twice daily for 8 weeks reduces body weight, fat mass, waist circumference, and hip circumference when used along with a diet.
Stomach ulcers. People who eat capsicum fruit (chili) an average of 24 times per month appear to be less likely to have an ulcer than people who eat chili an average of 8 times per month. This applies to chili in the form of chili powder, chili sauce, curry powder, and other chili-containing foods. But there is other evidence that suggests eating chili peppers does not help heal ulcers.
Nerve damage in the hands and feet (peripheral neuropathy). Early clinical research shows that applying a specific patch containing 8% capsaicin one time can reduce pain for up to 12 weeks in people with nerve pain from cancer and nerve pain in the back. However, it is not clear if this is due to a placebo effect. This product is available by prescription only.
A skin condition that causes extremely itchy, hard lumps to form on skin (prurigo nodularis). Applying a cream containing capsaicin, the active chemical in capsicum, 4-6 times daily seems to relieve burning sensations, itching and other symptoms. But it may take 22 weeks to 33 months of treatment to see a benefit, and symptoms may return after stopping use cream.
Polyps in the nose and sinus (sinonasal polyposis). Early research shows that putting capsicum in the nose improves symptoms and airflow in people with polyps.
Trouble swallowing. Some research shows that dissolving a capsaicin-containing lozenge in the mouth before each meal can improve an elderly person's ability to swallow. There is also some evidence that capsaicin improves swallowing and eating in people who have had a stroke.

Taking bifidobacteria plus lactobacillus along with standard H. pylori therapy might help get rid of H. pylori infections about twice as well as taking standard H. pylori therapy alone. It can also reduce side effects such as diarrhea and bad taste from H. pylori therapy.
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Most research shows that taking bifidobacteria for 4-8 weeks can reduce IBS symptoms such as stomach pain, bloating, and difficulty having a bowel movement. It might also reduce symptoms such as anxiety and depression in people with IBS. But not all strains of bifidobacteria seem to work.
A complication after surgery for ulcerative colitis called pouchitis. Taking a combination of bifidobacteria and lactobacillus, with or without streptococcus, by mouth seems to help prevent pouchitis after surgery for ulcerative colitis.
Airway infections. Most research shows that using probiotics containing bifidobacteria helps prevent airway infections such as the common cold in otherwise healthy people, including school-aged children and college students. But taking bifidobacteria does not seem to reduce the risk of airway infections in hospitalized children and teens.
Diarrhea in infants (rotaviral diarrhea). Giving bifidobacteria to infants with rotaviral diarrhea can shorten the duration of diarrhea by about one day.
Traveler's diarrhea. Taking bifidobacteria helps prevent traveler's diarrhea when used with other probiotics such as lactobacillus or streptococcus.
Ulcerative colitis. Research shows that taking probiotics containing bifidobacterium along with lactobacillus and streptococcus can help increase remission rate by almost 2-fold in people with active ulcerative colitis. However, most research shows that bifidobacterium is not beneficial for preventing relapse.Possibly ineffective for...

Diarrhea caused by antibiotics. Research shows that taking bifidobacteria along with antibiotics can reduce the chance of diarrhea by about 45%. But some conflicting results exist. It is possible that bifidobacteria might prevent diarrhea caused by some antibiotics but not others. Also, bifidobacteria might work better when used in certain combinations with lactobacillus and streptococcus. But not all combination seem to work.
Scaly, itchy skin (eczema). Some research shows that giving bifidobacterium to infants can help TREAT eczema, but conflicting results exist. Other research shows that giving bifidobacteria plus lactobacillus to pregnant women during the last 2 months of pregnancy, and then giving to the infant for the first 2 months after birth, can help PREVENT eczema. But conflicting results exist. Giving bifidobacteria plus lactobacillus to only at-risk infants during the first 6 months of life does not prevent eczema.
Bipolar disorder. Early research shows that taking bifidobacterium with lactobacillus GG seems to reduce the likelihood that a person with bipolar disorder will be hospitalized for psychotic symptoms. It also seems to decrease the time they spend in the hospital.

Diabetes. Early research shows that taking bifidobacteria along with lactobacillus helps lower fasting blood sugar and insulin levels in people with diabetes during pregnancy.
Muscle pain caused by exercise. Early research shows that taking bifidobacteria plus streptococcus doesn't reduce muscle soreness caused by lifting weights. But it does seem to improve range of motion during follow-up exercises despite muscle soreness.
High cholesterol. Early research shows that drinking milk containing bifidobacteria plus lactobacillus can reduce ""bad"" low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by a small amount in adults and children with high cholesterol. But its effects on ""good"" high-density lipoprotein cholesterol are conflicting.

MPlusHerbsSupplements,https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/891.html,"Bifidobacteria belong to a group of bacteria called lactic acid bacteria. Lactic acid bacteria are found in fermented foods like yogurt and cheese. Bifidobacteria are used in treatment as so-called ""probiotics,"" the opposite of antibiotics. They are considered ""friendly"" bacteria and are taken to grow and multiply in areas of the body where they normally would occur. The human body counts on its normal bacteria to perform several jobs, including breaking down foods, helping the body take in nutrients, and preventing the take-over of ""bad"" bacteria. Probiotics such as bifidobacteria are typically used in cases when a disease occurs or might occur due to a kill-off of normal bacteria. For example, treatment with antibiotics can destroy disease-causing bacteria, but also normal bacteria in the GI (gastrointestinal) and urinary tracts. The theory is that taking Bifidobacterium probiotics during antibiotic treatment can prevent or minimize the death of good bacteria and the take-over by bad bacteria.",how does it work,Bifidobacteria,What is the action of Bifidobacteria and how does it work ?,Drugs

Pregnancy and breast-feeding: A specific strain of bifidobacteria, Bifidobacterium bifidum, is POSSIBLY SAFE when taken by mouth appropriately for 6 weeks while pregnant. There is not enough reliable information about the safety of taking other bifidobacteria strains if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.
Weakened immune system: There is some concern that ""probiotics"" might grow too well in people with a weak immune system and cause infections. Although this has not occurred specifically with bifidobacteria, there have been rare cases involving other probiotic species such as Lactobacillus. If you have a weakened immune system (e.g., you have HIV/AIDS or are undergoing cancer treatment), check with your healthcare provider before using bifidobacteria.
Blockage in the intestines: Two cases of blood infections have been reported for infants given bifidobacteria probiotics. In both cases, the infants had had stomach surgery. It's thought that the blood infections resulted from intestinal blockage caused by the stomach surgeries, which allowed the bifidobacteria to cross into the bloodstream. In one case, taking bifidobacteria after the intestinal blockage was corrected did not cause another blood infection. Therefore the risk of blood infections is not a concern for most infants taking bifidobacteria.

MPlusHerbsSupplements,https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/935.html,"When taken by mouth: Guarana is LIKELY SAFE for most adults when taken in amounts commonly found in foods. When taken by mouth in medicinal amounts for a short time, guarana is POSSIBLY SAFE.

When taken by mouth in high doses for a long time, guarana is POSSIBLY UNSAFE. Guarana contains caffeine. Doses containing more than 400 mg of caffeine daily have been linked to side effects. Side effects depend on the dose. At typical doses, the caffeine in guarana can cause insomnia, nervousness and restlessness, stomach irritation, nausea, vomiting, increased heart rate and blood pressure, rapid breathing, tremors, delirium, diuresis, and other side effects. Large guarana doses might cause headache, anxiety, agitation, ringing in the ears, pain when urinating, stomach cramps, and irregular heartbeats. People who take guarana regularly may experience caffeine withdrawal symptoms if they reduce their usual dose.

When taken by mouth or injected in very high doses, guarana is LIKELY UNSAFE and even deadly, due to its caffeine content. The fatal dose of caffeine is estimated to be 10-14 grams. Serious poisoning can also occur at lower doses, depending on an individual's caffeine sensitivity or smoking behavior, age, and prior caffeine use.


Special precautions & warnings:
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Guarana is POSSIBLY SAFE for pregnant and breast feeding women when taken in amounts commonly found in foods. If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, guarana should be taken with caution due to the caffeine content. Small amounts are probably not harmful. However, taking guarana in high doses by mouth is POSSIBLY UNSAFE. Consuming more than 300 mg of caffeine daily has been linked to an increased risk of miscarriage and other negative effects.

In women who are nursing, caffeine passes into breast milk and can affect a nursing infant. Nursing mothers should closely monitor caffeine intake to make sure it is on the low side. High intake of caffeine by nursing mothers can cause sleep problems, irritability, and increased bowel activity in breast-fed infants.
Anxiety: The caffeine in guarana might make feelings of anxiety worse.
Bleeding disorders: There is some evidence suggesting that the caffeine in guarana might make bleeding disorders worse, although this has not been reported in people. If you have a bleeding disorder, check with your healthcare provider before starting guarana.
Diabetes: Some research suggests that the caffeine in guarana may affect the way people with diabetes process sugar (glucose) and may complicate blood sugar control. There is also some interesting research that suggests caffeine may enhance the warning symptoms of low blood sugar in patients with type 1 diabetes. Some studies show that the symptoms of low blood sugar are more intense when they start in the absence of caffeine, but as low blood sugar continues, symptoms are greater with caffeine. This might increase the ability of diabetic patients to detect and treat low blood sugar. However, the downside is that caffeine might actually increase the number of low-sugar episodes. If you have diabetes, talk with your healthcare provider before starting guarana.
 Diarrhea. Guarana contains caffeine. The caffeine in guarana, especially when taken in large amounts, can worsen diarrhea.
Seizures. Guarana contains caffeine. The caffeine in guarana might increase the risk of seizures and reduce the benefits of many medications used to control seizures. If you have seizures, talk to your healthcare provider before using guarana.
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): Guarana contains caffeine. The caffeine in guarana, especially when taken in large amounts, can worsen diarrhea and might worsen the diarrhea some people have with IBS.
Heart disease: The caffeine in guarana might cause irregular heartbeat in certain people. Use with caution.
High blood pressure: Taking guarana might raise blood pressure, in people with high blood pressure due to its caffeine content. However, this effect might be less in people who are regular coffee-drinkers or otherwise use caffeine on a regular basis.
Glaucoma: The caffeine in guarana increases the pressure inside the eye. The increase occurs within 30 minutes and lasts for at least 90 minutes after drinking caffeinated beverages.
Bladder control problems (Incontinence): Guarana contains caffeine. The caffeine in guarana might reduce bladder control, especially in older women. If you need to urinate often with high urgency, use guarana cautiously.
Osteoporosis: The caffeine in guarana can flush calcium out of the body through the kidneys. This calcium loss might weaken bones. If you have osteoporosis, don't consume more than 300 mg of caffeine per day. Taking calcium supplements may also help to replace any lost calcium. If you are generally healthy and getting enough calcium from your food or supplements, taking up to 400 mg of caffeine per day doesn't seem to increase the risk of getting osteoporosis.

Some coconut oil products are referred to as ""virgin"" coconut oil. Unlike olive oil, there is no industry standard for the meaning of ""virgin"" coconut oil. The term has come to mean that the oil is generally unprocessed. For example, virgin coconut oil usually has not been bleached, deodorized, or refined.

Some coconut oil products claim to be ""cold pressed"" coconut oil. This generally means that a mechanical method of pressing out the oil is used, but without the use of any outside heat source. The high pressure needed to press out the oil generates some heat naturally, but the temperature is controlled so that temperatures do not exceed 120 degrees Fahrenheit.

High levels of cholesterol or other fats (lipids) in the blood (hyperlipidemia). Taking blond psyllium by mouth reduces cholesterol levels in people with mild to moderate high cholesterol. Blond psyllium added to food or as a separate supplement of approximately 10-12 grams daily can reduce levels of total cholesterol by 3% to 14% and low density lipoprotein (LDL or ""bad"") cholesterol by 5% to 10% after 7 weeks or more of treatment.

In children with high cholesterol, taking psyllium can further decrease LDL cholesterol levels by 7% to 15% when added to a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet such as the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Step 1 diet. Interestingly, taking blond psyllium along with a stricter low-fat, low-cholesterol diet such as the NCEP Step 2 diet may have less of an additional effect in lowering LDL cholesterol.
